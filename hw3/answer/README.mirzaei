My groupmate and I collaborated closely on this homework assignment, sharing the workload and making equal contributions. Specifically, I took responsibility for fixing the attention module and incorporating Beam Searching into the implementation. On the other hand, my groupmate focused on optimizing the code related to those specific components. Additionally, he attempted to implement Ensemble decoding. Unfortunately, it did not function as intended and failed to enhance the accuracy.
