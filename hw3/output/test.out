i 'll tell you today about the last of the last 30 years . 
it 's pretty much for 18 minutes . 
it 's a complex , we start directly at a complex place : new jersey . 
because 30 years ago , i met a with with my new in in a city called north , and that was my . . 
in my my was the the i i was with my sister . 
between my bedroom and the the was a with with . 
and everybody looked down and looked at night , so i always looked at the the i went into the bathroom , and when i went and and and and , and i . 
and i looked like this . 
i was living , i and i hated . 
i hated this , , i i , i this room and this house . 
and that architecture architecture 
this feeling , my my emotions , that is the power of architecture , because architecture architecture is not about math and and , it 's about the , , of connections that we have with places we live . 
and we do n't think we feel so , because the [ ] americans americans americans in 90 percent of their time . 
so we 're 90 percent of our time . 
it 's enormous . 
it means architecture architecture us a kind of a that that not aware of us . 
that makes us naive and very . 
and i i i show you a a building building , i know what you think think about " power " " 
and they think that because it 's building building building that has been two years ago . 
this is a trick . 
these this use architects architects to make emotional emotional to forms that we built our buildings . 
it 's a emotional emotional , and we use this for a . 
we were the the 200 200 years ago . 
we found him in the 19th century . 
we were building so . . 
look at these these , tiny tiny soldiers that the the the and the the . 
it 's very useful because because things is essential . 
it 's expensive , it takes very complicated . 
people build things -- and and governments -- of course , innovation innovation , they use the the that that they . 
this leads to buildings . 
it 's a beautiful building . 
but it does n't have a lot to what what library library . 
in the , 2004 , the the other side of the united states and the looks looks like this . 
this is in seattle . 
the library is about the digital digital digital digital . 
it 's a new kind of public facility for the city , a place to the and to the . 
so how is it possible in the same country in two country , both of these different different ? 
architecture is based on a . . 
on one side , innovation innovation is architects , the new new technologies technologies new new new new new new new new solutions for us as we live today . 
we all all black , , very depressed . they think us , but we 're dead dead because we have no choice . 
we need to move the side and symbols symbols that love love . 
if we do that and they 're happy , we feel like like . so so we we again , we we the the the , and we the last 300 years for years . 
thirty years ago , 
official architects architects with the called " . 
and it concrete concrete . 
small windows , enormous . 
it 's really stuff . 
when we sat the the , we started these symbols . 
we we back back in the other direction . 
we took the forms that they like , and they . 
we hired and and and and new new . 
and they loved . 
they did n't enough enough . 
we took and and and them in . . . can build three . . 
shapes became big , and and . 
we were columns . 
it was crazy . 
but that was the . 
so was the in . 
that was with symbols . 
they were easy and cheap , rather than creating these memories . 
i know , and i know you know , this is not the . 
this is ohio . 
the the the and the beginning of the we called the called " . 
we looked at the , behind behind us , we ourselves , new and and new forms forms that shapes forms different forms . 
that was a and exciting , was very , we we completely it . 
so that would just just back back . 
but then something surprising . 
1997 was building building . 
this is the most bilbao of frank . 
this building changed the relationship of the world . architecture . 
according paul was the most of of the moments moments , in , , and and the public . 
new york times called this building . 
the tourism grew in about two percent , after the construction . 
he 's our first good . 
how is it possible that these shapes -- wild and radically -- how is it possible to spread around ? 
this is what the media were successfully , and and quickly us to shapes shapes shapes . 
these shapes did us emotional emotional emotional . 
just like in . 
everybody knows that those shapes culture and culture . 
so this is also some some . 
think about your . 
in hundred years ago , they have to go to village village to a building . 
the is , you take a boat , a plane , you open a . 
the technology : you see it in newspapers , in the , until all all the , and the the by the . . 
architecture is everywhere everywhere , the the rate of the the the the architecture . 
because architecture is pretty fast . 
it does n't long , building building . 
but it takes long building building building , three years four years , and in the , two architect , two , or two other , , before he knows whether the computer that was built four years ago , a success . 
this is a most good good architecture . architecture architecture . 
so we have these buildings . 
this will never happen again , i think we 're in the largest revolution in the architecture of the invention of the invention or the or or . 
according to the theory of the , always , if you if you 're at all time , time , at both time , in the the difference between innovation and real and , , between us , and the . 
now we can almost the the of my own . 
this is a project that we have recently . 
we became more to build this . . 
this is the center of a city called called in new york . 
it 's a moral . 
we proposed a a building that we all have different difference , and we were , , our clients , and the community , we were a a set of of that we on facebook and on the , and we people people doing it , it 's , ,
it meant two years ago , a was a the community , the the the the the the . 
this building was already part of this community , and in the first summer , and people started building the building in the media , was not a building building , but it was not a medium . because 's not just a of these images . 
so we need no greeks greeks that tell us what to think about architecture . 
we can tell each other what we think about architecture , because the media media have not changed the relationship between us , have changed relationship relationship between us . 
think about a second in the . 
if the building building today would be today would go to the first online and new new . . 
they would go with experimental , open - , that that the the of the , which library . 
this is . . 
that is the to take you to the and and the to the people to you , , there 's not just a answer to what a library today . 
let 's part part . 
this abundance of these experiments are giving them their own experiment . 
everything changed . 
architects are not an creatures creatures , the large words and complicated drawings and they 're not the the public -- -- consumers consumers -- nothing does n't mean . he does n't have . 
architects can you hear , and architecture not not them . 
that 's the end of the that the future are building very different than the current building . 
it means a public space in the of of unique and and in ways to a a a city . 
a a in brooklyn is a a in brooklyn , not not to sound from from ideas from a . . 
robots robots our buildings building , because we finally finally for the to produce them . 
buildings buildings will be the the of nature of rather different . 
a rural in in miami , florida , can can be place where you can or or or in , and you can get there until late . 
so means that means a small small is small for innovation innovation that this little that that the the and and the media , the same , he designed designed . 
so a building does not be beautiful beautiful to be to be like this this little tiny building in the where the architects a a hole , with with , , , , , , , , and , and , and , and , the , of the ,
it does n't matter whether a build our buildings , or a robot our building building . 
it 's really how we build it it 's just important we build . 
architects know how to call " , and and building buildings . 
we only have it to it . 
we 're not longer on on right . 
find a architect , you a architects , design it with us better better better better better better and better better world , because it 's a lot of stake . 
no only not only society society , , they them them to the to the smallest places : the the where they their kids , their way , the the they 're from the . 
thank you . 
my niece , 
it was been a year and started begun . 
they walks on the cool way like this is running , a a , after the , my body is too for my legs . 
it looks totally cute . 
and one of the is is , in the mirror . 
she she her her . 
they get , and and are even these big , mental . . 
when suddenly suddenly n't n't be to his his smart ? ? 
because we do n't do 
every month would you people people google google , " am i ugly ? " 
this is is . 13 and in in . . 
and everyone everybody wants to just run them and 
it 's your something something . it 's something confused , even your your your her her her she says she she says she says she says you 're telling you every school school school 
because her mother is telling her and her friends or something something something else , do n't know who should n't believe . 
some of them are so you should not think about them . 
this is a , , for girls girls who this this feedback of of their emotional 's life . 
well , the teenagers of today are rarely . 
they 're under pressure , always online and online , they talk , writing , writing , , " , , , , , , , , it . 
never before we were so so so so , so so , so young . 
one mother said to me , is like every night at a time . 
you just have no . 
and the pressure pressure , the human is is . . 
this is teaches teaches kids kids to self - based of the of of " and the the the the that that you . 
there 's no separation between online and and . 
what real real is what it 's not really hard to say . 
what 's their source of inspiration ? 
you can see the pictures that in the the the . 
perfect with greatness are still still . 
and is today . 
and trends like mahmoud , , , , , both and and . 
by , , consumers . 
these trends are with with the and and women women women . 
today , you can easily easily with girls . 
but the are not effective . 
the pursuit after the and and the the of and and . 
but what 's the problem ? 
we want want to to our children to be people . 
but in a culture of culture culture culture , our children to our more and more time and thoughts to the about all of other aspects aspects . 
that their relationships their relationships , and and school , to suffer . 
six - making girls do n't make you feel good enough . 
and that 's not the activities . 
it 's fundamental activity in their development as human and and and to society and to . 
31 percent , about one three three times at a discussion in classroom , they do n't because they do n't want to attention to their their . 
one - five - is not at school . 
if you think you 're not good at or or not , you 're not enough , you average average , you have a bad worse than that . 
and that 's all the case in finland . 
and china , and much much how much actually . 
to understand that , it 's about how you you you , and not how you 
funny . 
but it also the health . 
teenagers with with smart less less less food less less and vegetables , control , , and the is and and . 
and it does n't . 
women who think they 're 're -- and again , they matter , whether they 're not -- they 're not . 
17 percent of women would not go to a a , they do n't look at their . 
think about what that does with the economy . 
if we could overcome what possibilities possibilities . 
this potential is , in the interest of every one of us . 
how do we do ? 
just 's not not us . 
it alone is not enough . 
if we want to move , we need to do something . 
here are three dimensions : first we teach them . 
we need to help our efforts , strategies to , to the the of the and and the . 
the good news is that there are many programs . 
but the bad news is most most work . 
i was shocked to understand that the programs have the situation . 
we need to make sure that the programs that our children children children not not just a positive but but also have an impact . 
research research shows the best best for the first time the first of the family and friends and relationships . 
second , media and the . and the with with with and and and we with with others and and us with us , and look at what people people call " the " " " " " " " and " and and and and and and for itself
it 's how to women women and women . 
it 's not okay that we get our contribution of because of their own , the size of their own , or , that success is a matter of their . 
we need to start them to their actions , and not what they look . 
we can all all to take responsibility for the images and the we we in social networks . 
we can give people people their their and their their and not for their appearance . 
and i ask you , when did you have a mirror ? 
we need to learn as communities , governments and local work to make something our our our our our and , and diversity . 
we need to people who really want to make , , , make them in in the world . 
we need to get the stage , because the changes changes . 
a world where our kids have freedom , the best to their own version of their own thoughts , which they thought about their sense of their they 're not about being , or they do what they want . 
bear what this could be in your life . 
a friend ? or the woman just just something . 
what would it mean for you , if you could agree with voice , your your , that you your your , , legs , , , smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller ? 
what would it mean for you , and that 's their potential ? 
today , all us us our our culture . 
let 's say our kids . 
let 's show you that this is just part of our identity and and we actually love love for what they 're doing what they 're doing and what they give us a sense . 
first need to curriculum . 
every single one of us should we how to talk about others . 
we 're working communities from the from the to the governments that the the most of the are are becoming . . 
let 's go . 
in the , a man was a young woman in in manhattan , and and a a of of on on the , the the of the . 
so , was from the the of the , but while he was his for for for for his , , he and and other men , to a dozen new , , including , , , and the united nations . 
luckily , these plans were by by a . 
sadly was the first first to the the . . 
i was raised in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , son son was a and and a and and and , who was their best to to give me a . 
only when i was seven years , started started to change . 
my father showed me a page of the , just very few people including the majority of muslims muslims . 
but there 's any religion in every every every single people , a little percentage of people who are so loved to their believing , they believe they have to everything in their power to to others to to others . 
we came to the the without without our knowledge . 
day the last last little little little light light across the the , and the surprise of all , my left went to the . 
and he seemed to very laugh to , but i realized , but only a few years later what they think . 
they thought i had the same same as my father . 
these men were all up to the a of a of pounds pounds of the of of the the , and the the six people and six people . 
these these were left . 
these men called me " " " " as " as uncle . " 
when i was useless , we were born for , and these childhood childhood childhood gave me give me to chance . 
once i had to get a little bit of , it was time to go the and and into the next city . 
because i was always new new in the , i was the victim of . 
so i spent the most home . i read reading books , or playing games . 
so i taught me -- -- to express -- and i was in a a in a , and i was n't prepared to the real world . 
i was been to to people people to , like their their or their religion . 
so what happened ? 
one of my first experiences my my mindset my work was working in the . 
when i was college college , i was at national national in in in . 
the most of my was was , , and i was almost my whole life of the , , this subject of emotions . 
the members of our group came from different different . 
on the first day , i found out that a boy was i was was . 
there had a few days days until this detail came came , and me , that we were n't were n't natural . . 
there was people people all and and and and and that experience my my my . 
this feeling of me me to the that that taught me as a child in in real life . 
i do n't know how to be gay , but i know very good , what it is to be something that 's worth my control . 
then there was the show show . 
inspiration comes from by , , and the fact that a a black international international international is is better than my my father is not to me . 
one day i had a conversation with my my own , and , and she said to something that i me , i i live in my heart . 
she saw me the the eyes of a woman who had her life her life , and said , " i am sorry to hate people . " 
in that moment , realized , how much negative energy energy is to get this hatred . 
moral moral is not my name . 
i changed him as my family decided to to my my my my father and a new life . 
so why am i and and feel at danger ? 
it 's very simple . 
instead , i my my , against terrorism , against the the . 
i do it for the victims of the terrorism and for the the pain pain and loss , which has given the terrorism of your life . 
i ' m talking about the terrorism of these missing and and the of my . 
with the , , i ' m living living proof that violence not not in religion religion or and and the the the not not the the the . 
i am not my dad . 
in this moment a movie has your head . 
it 's a psychologist , film film . 
he 's 3d with with for all of you you see and and . but it 's just the beginning . 
your film has taste taste and touch . 
he has a sense of their body , pain , 
he 's emotions , anger . 
he memory memories memories , for instance childhood that they before . 
and he got a : : the . 
in the movie , you can see all the right . 
the movie is your mind of consciousness , how your mind and mind . 
consciousness is one of the fundamental elements of human . 
we have aware . 
we all our our own inner , , , and she . 
there 's nothing we 're . 
at least my mind . 
i ca n't tell you they 're consciously . 
our consciousness is also life life makes . 
we would not aware of anything in our life or meaning . 
it 's also the phenomenon phenomenon universe . 
why are n't easy robots robots all the all the input and all the the without this movie movie ? 
at this point , nobody respond respond to these questions . 
i say that some some ideas ideas will be to to the the of of scientific scientific . 
some claim , a science consciousness impossible . 
science is inherently . 
consciousness is inherently from inherently . 
so can never be a science of consciousness . 
most of the 20th century was this . 
psychologists our behavior behavior , neuroscientists creates the brain , and nobody else only mentioned . 
thirty years ago , when was founded , the the the of scientific scientific . 
twenty years ago . 
neuroscientists like francis crick and physicists physicists physicists like roger as that that time time to have to to the . 
there was a real explosion . 
this work is great . it 's great . 
but she also has some basic boundaries . 
one part of these work we saw saw young young when they were their wonderful work . 
now we we better for a lot better , what the with perception of of perceptions or or or joy . 
but that 's still a science of 
it 's not science . 
we know that these interactions with certain species of the , but we do n't know why they do . 
i see that these kind of the of some of the questions for consciousness to consider the answers -- the question of what do do do do . 
but in some ways , the simple problems . 
nothing against . 
there is no simple problems . 
but the does n't the the puzzle that the this : why do n't all the physical processes of the matter ? 
why does this inner , ? 
there 's no answer to this question . 
now you may just should just just just a few years . 
it 's going to create another interesting phenomenon , like like , life like life , and we 'll explain it . 
the the problems of the the of of the : how how happiness , like how a a organism organism , and and and , , all of things . 
you could think of the human brain by using behaviors and functions of human brain , as explains as we can how we play how to play , questions . 
but when it is about consciousness , is asking questions behavior . 
if there 's complicated issues , the question is , why all these behaviors are becoming a . 
in fact , the the the the cancer , the the neuroscience is far far far . 
science is , i am in heart . 
i want to make a scientific theory for the , work for a long time time i have for a theory of consciousness that totally totally physical and and it works . 
but i had to suggest that for did did . 
so i think we 're a a . 
we have this wonderful wonderful wonderful , , so it it 's the the physics physics physics physics explains explains chemistry chemistry biology biology biology biology biology . 
but consciousness does n't seem to fit that model . 
on one side , it is that we are aware . 
on the other hand , we do n't know how to invest our our . 
so i think consciousness is a moment of a kind of material that we have to in our own , but not exactly how . 
and with such a a could be radical radical ideas , and i think we could use two or two ideas that will start crazy before we we the the in the . 
there are some candidates that this ideas ideas come . 
my friend dan dan who 's here is one of those ideas . 
he thinks that there 's no problem problem consciousness . 
the concept concept of the chemical chemical in a way . 
we really need to explain the function of the brain , and then we explained everything that needs . 
i say just just about this ! 
that 's the kind of ideas that we need to explore when we have a and and and mathematical consciousness . 
but that view for me and many other other people , because they were the existence of human consciousness . 
so i go another . 
i ' m going to look at two ideas ideas on which i think you might be . 
the first crazy idea is consciousness is consciousness . 
physicists look some some aspects of the ocean as space space and time . 
they make fundamental laws based on them , the laws of gravity or the quantum mechanics . 
these fundamental properties and laws are not about anything . 
they 're seen as a and and in the basis . 
sometimes it 's the the list of the things . 
in the 19th century , discovered found that you can not the the the of the fundamental things : space space time , time , newton , , , , , , and it 's to the laws of the and and the electric charge , a particular . 
i think we 're in the minds in the same situation . 
if you think consciousness the the elements of not , -- space , time , mass , -- the the is the to to the the list . 
the natural consequence would be consciousness consciousness itself as a human to a a human nature . 
it does n't mean you can n't . 
it opens the way to stop . 
what we need to do is fundamental fundamental that are consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness to the other fundamental fundamental , space , time , time , physical , . 
physicists sometimes sometimes , we need fundamental laws that are so so you can wear on the . . 
i think we 're conscious in consciousness . 
we want to find laws laws that so that you can print them on a . . 
we do n't know yet that laws are but we work . 
the second second idea is that consciousness could be . 
every system could have a certain way . 
this this is sometimes sometimes called a , " " " everything , " , , , system , not a , , not only humans , dogs , mice , mice , but even , it 's , it 's . 
even each has has a a . 
this approach does n't tell that smart intelligent can or . 
a 's is not , , and , , ah , i . 
i never never myself and . " 
no , not . 
but the idea is that maybe may have some kind of certain , feeling feeling , a kind of noise of consciousness . 
it might be a little . 
i mean why should anyone something like this ? 
part part is the first first idea that idea is consciousness . 
if it 's an , like space , and and mass , is that it could be be , as they 're . 
you also have to say that this idea that we us , , for people people people , but far less less less is in in cultures , the human mind in nature with nature . 
a 's motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the best way to the the fundamental laws between conscious and physical information , to connect information information information . 
where there are there , there 's consciousness . 
complex models like humans in complex . 
simple simple -- simple consciousness . 
exciting is that in recent years , a a , , , that the this notion of this theory has mathematical mathematical mathematical mathematical mathematical . 
he takes a mathematical of of the called called called " to measure the the in a system . 
and he found the with awareness minds . 
so the human brain , a large large amount of heart , a huge level level of , . 
in a mouse , middle amount of suffering , still very high -- very level level . 
but if we continue further , microbes , , , , takes down . 
the are also , but still larger . 
according 's why it 's still still to be the . 
in fact , he was a a law law of consciousness : what the mind . 
i do n't know if this theory is right , but it could be the the theory theory in the science of consciousness consciousness and and it 's the the of a whole series of data , it 's simply simply to to the the of a golf . 
another another thing is that we help us to the consciousness in the physical world . 
physicists and philosophers have realized that physics physics physics . 
they describes the structure of reality a a series of of , but they 're not telling about about reality reality that their underlying . 
stephen stephen says , what 's the animal life ? " 
in the of of the , the the of physics , how you are , but you can use them to the the electricity of consciousness . 
that is what the physics does is to the power of consciousness . 
so , is the consciousness that the the . 
but the mind , consciousness not the outside of physical world . 
it 's in your center . 
i think these major approaches has changed the potential to change our relationship to the and and that might have some ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical consequences . 
some of them may be intuitive . 
i thought , i should n't eat anything , and that 's why . 
if you you the the , you will be very hungry . 
i think think about it , might change our view , as what 's from from and and and , is less less of consciousness , but rather than the and the complexity of consciousness . 
it 's also what to find in other systems systems like like for computers . 
what about the intelligent system system in the movie , ? 
is it consciously ? 
and you you the , , , , you think they have a certain level of health and and . so should should be . 
if the right is , , serious issues are issues , both the cause of economic markets and also to the . 
finally , you have the awareness groups , the planet . 
has canada a personal consciousness ? 
or at the level , a a group of the like the audience of a conference , we just saw a a ; ; there 's a movie movie for this individual of that is inside the inside of each other ? 
i know the answer to this question , but i think they should should be at least . 
okay , vision vision is radical , and i do n't know if she 's right . 
i ' m actually the by the first crazy idea that consciousness is consciousness than the second second . 
this this raises of questions , many many challenges challenges , like like individual parts of the and and complexity complexity of consciousness that we know and love . 
if we find out , we 're on the right theory of consciousness . 
if not , that 's the science problem in science and philosophy . 
we ca n't expect to fix it overnight . 
but i think we will ultimately it . 
i think understanding understanding our consciousness is both key key understanding understanding of understanding understanding understanding of understanding ourselves . 
it just needs just to be . 
thank you . 
i grew up in a very small town in 
childhood childhood is normal . 
i went to school , with friends friends , my my my sisters . 
it was all natural . 
when i was a a parents , my parents , wanted to help for a for for for . 
my parents said , " well , this is really nice , but there 's a moral problem . 
you know , nothing 's nothing . " 
i went to school , school grades grades , school school school a little bit of my school and and spent spent a lot of time , " the the of the and and " 
yeah , i know . 
but they were right . 
years later , while my was in a high school in in , , 20 minutes in the , and she said , and when she start talking about your speech ? " 
" speech ? " i wanted . 
i had 20 minutes about and and talked . 
he said , " you know , well , your . . 
when someone realized in this , , this person was answered . 
normally normally that in the . 
there was a light : this young man with disability with a major american . 
we him -- we ca n't it it , too . 
many people are not teachers doctors doctors doctors . 
we 're not real people . 
and actually , i 'll sit here on this stage , and i i in the wheelchair , and you probably expect me to me , i right . right ? 
ladies and gentlemen , i have to get . . 
i ' m not here to inspire them . 
i ' m going to tell you that when we were . 
disability is not , and she does n't matter . 
in the last few years , we could actually see these these social media . 
you probably probably pictures like this : " the only disability in life is a bad mindset . " 
or , " your is is disabled . " 
or before you get , you get . ! " 
these are just a few ; there are many many of images . 
you may know familiar with little little girl without the pen in the mouth . 
you may have seen the child that 's on . 
and these images , there are many of call call call . 
i use the word , because because people make people to other people . 
you make a objects that can can benefit . 
such images these have have to inspire , to , , , the the and and , " " my life my life is , it might be worse . 
i could be that . 
but what if you 're that person ? 
i i count counting , often often often me me to tell me that they me me , or , , , and that was been before my work was done . 
i found you that i stand up and i to my name , and that 's a human being made . 
all these images are objects objects objects the the . 
so are are there to be you can can look at yourself and feel his . . 
it 's really hard to disability . 
we have so much . 
but what we do is not what they 're . 
it has nothing to do with our body . 
i was absolutely intent with the , because i , i the social model of disability , and we are rather disabled through society society in which we live in our bodies and 
i have been in in this . 
i love him . 
he 's doing what 's going , and i ' m to learn to use his skills , as much as it 's . 
they do nothing . 
they just use their body as well . 
is it really fair to how you can and objects ? 
when people say they 're a inspiration , they want a . 
i know why . 
because of the lie that was was : disability disability . 
i continue on over inspiration and they think , " man , will you never do ? " 
but yes . 
i constantly constantly from other . 
i did n't think i was lucky . 
i i think it 's a great idea to get a with a because of the the trick that is with the battery of the . 
genius ! 
we learn from the strength and the of the not not against our bodies and bodies against a world that makes us more . 
i think that lie is disability disability disability . 
it makes us life . 
and the quote only the only life in life is a bad mindset , because because it 's not because because of the social . 
you can take the the long , , you still n't get . 
it will never happen . 
i want to live in a world where the disability . 
in a girl who 's in in her room -- " the the the the , " not as as a , because it 's sitting in the . 
i want to live in a world where you do n't expect so little from the to to the and you send your name . 
i want to live in a world where the actual achievement is is is , i want to live in a world 's school student in class , not who he his his new teacher in the wheelchair . 
not disability makes us extraordinary , but the the our our . 
thank you . 
what have an objective reality and and empathy empathy empathy ? 
how fast is is the in the air ? 
unfortunately , i ' m not just one of these questions , not to . 
most people think of a at a and and and tom tom tom , he he in the air , but he 's not science . 
it 's something that faster faster when we 're thinking , our our , and it will get because we have to have the technologies technologies , and you have to be aware of our life , it 's our life and the phone . 
how do we get it ? 
the first step , i was wearing : google glass . 
many of you know google . 
you may not know that google is a device that allows you to see what i see . 
and to what it is to be as as on the field . 
now you can only experience it when i recommend it . 
i have to put it . 
i have to create a framework to use it . 
google can put a put a under a helmet and a sense of how it 's to to with things things to fly and and to the whole body . 
you can experience how it 's when they 're and they and and trying to trying to use them . 
i experienced it firsthand , it feels not good . 
here 's the video . 
go . 
open , being is . . 
i i get closer . 
are you ? 
go . 
they have certain that people are missing : the rest of the team . 
we have a video of from university . 
rs : hey , excellent ! 
blue blue ! blue ! ! 
oh ! 
that want this experience . 
want on the field . 
they want to be their , and and i on youtube and twitter , " can you give that a moral ? 
once we experience the experience with both and google , how do we make it better ? 
what 's the next ? 
the the is is one of the most successful of of times , and it 's not just a . 
and i can show you with this video why . 
oh ! 
no ! no ! no ! ! 
oh my god ! 
so a man man a a and and to his life . 
how will it be him if he at a miles miles miles miles miles miles the mountain mountain oil ? 
adults , adults become again . 
but it 's not yet . 
that 's virtual reality . 
how do we go ? 
we can do if if , , managers and and and that information and , " how do we make our our ? 
how can we win this ? 
teams use technologies technologies to games . 
they love to make money . 
a quick story of the . 
so the the the of of their own machine that that could sell faster . 
they won the . 
other teams example . 
more people more than the 
we were . faster . 
1994 was the the of the the of the , , the the . 
more people more people who have . 
and new . 
imagine you want to play . . you back to the and and see the next directly directly on your front that you 're already . 
no fear of dying . 
no fear of all all the learning . 
they go out and react . 
and the coaches would like that because you eat eat , , and lose . 
they then become . . 
they do n't . 
but he 's not just a moral . 
he allowed them to to all of data in time to improve their game . 
how does that ? 
a simple simple would would a camera of every corner of the the bottom of the . . 
they also also the the and the and and the technologies technologies that 's just working . 
they have all those data for their players . 
the good teams . 
the bad needs . 
that good good . 
and their their just as as as their , and and is is not just for . 
it 's true . 
how how do that look on ? 
imagine you 're . 
you get the ball . 
they look for free free . 
suddenly was a at a a at her her her and show show that the the of " . 
usually do n't see him , but he 's the the the . 
they go in . 
another another . 
they throw , but get . 
the ball is control . 
they do n't know where he goes . 
but on the top of the the will , it can . 
he can catch the ball , go . 
the crowd are the and the are are at him and and from every perspective . 
this becomes a new way for the . 
people will get to because they want this experience . 
the want to be on field . 
want to be . 
it becomes part of the because it does n't stop . 
but my question is , is we so happy to use it ? 
do we want to use and and normal normal ? 
i think we can use it for . 
i think we can use it to to people to people people people people by people by someone to someone someone else . 
we know what this technology is worth . 
they tested a high . 
what is this technology a a technology in uganda or russia , , world who wants to be under the conditions conditions ? 
what is this technology technology , or or or new media , that want to inspire a generation of kids , about and and and and and and ? 
ladies and gentlemen , the is reality . 
the questions we ask the choices that we make challenges challenges challenges we face , are , , , in our hand . 
thank you . 
i recently recently from the recently from the to the . 
most of the 23 years spent years i spent a hero of the the county of the the the the . 
the bridge is a moving that the around the world , san francisco , the the ocean and its its architecture . 
sadly , it 's also a too for suicide , because it belongs to the most most most most . 
the historical is killed . 
joseph , , the internet engineer , is words words words , " the bridge is is . 
suicide on the is is neither is probably . " 
but since since , , more than 600 600 from this bridge in the death . 
some people that the the between between two different different in another dimension -- the bridge -- that was -- -- by by the case of all all all and and and and the water , the water into the soul . 
i 'll tell you what happens when the bridge bridge means to be used . 
in are playing bones bones some some some organs organs . 
most die dying . 
those who dying die , most of in water water and and . 
i do n't think that the that of this kind of of of is , is a death death death death . 
this is the cable . 
apart from the the two two , 80 80 inches in the bridge . 
here 's most people before before they take life . 
i mean , i can tell you that one person who already on on the wires and and it 's in its lung , only very . 
i saw this photograph last year , when young young woman with a brilliant spoke and spoke about her life . 
i ' m glad to tell you that we were successful to the day , they on the other side of the . 
when i started working on the bridge , there was no training training . 
you took through your through your . . 
it was not just a fundamental for for , but for for . 
we have long long behind behind . 
today train and policemen and the new . . 
this is is . 
i met the last year at july 22 when i got a call in a room , a a a , the the middle of the middle of the . . 
i was and i was when i saw the he was a a a of the the . 
jason was just 32 32 and and new jersey . 
after about about a hour talking about about , he asked us if we know the story . 
we remember the greek greek : : brain and and they them to the , , together with a and and said , " never never , . 
and one day , the the the the , , the the . 
and came came , suffering and all sorts of politics that were over the . 
the good news in the . 
then asked jason us , " what happens if you go the the and and no hope ? 
he was a moment for a moment , was right . 
this nice smart boy man was new jersey was just alive . 
i i thought about this evening , and parents , and i i talked to them , i i was not doing so good because the next day , the the the the family for me to to me . 
and parents had asked . 
the identity of a is something like many people . 
i ask you why you would you do if a a , a friend or a person person ? 
what would you say ? 
would you know what you should ? 
my experience is not just about the talking , but listen . 
listen to understand . 
do n't you do n't have , , or say , you say , you 're not , you feel like you do n't know . 
just just just , , you may be the the point that person person . 
if you think someone is , you do n't fear fear person person . 
you might ask a question : " other people in situations situations about how to life life , " you thought that thought ? " 
the person lost that , , maybe their lives and she makes her point for her . 
other signs that you should think : : that the things that things are bad things and never better , , that believe that you ca n't do about about ; it 's against life and life and life of life . 
i i this talk to a few days ago , and i have email email email an email that i 'd like to share .

and at the end , she said , " when i saw the hospital francisco san francisco , they were were . 
boy i had to take that . " 
today 's a a father and a a member of society . 
he was talking about the the and and his depression in the hope that his story . 
suicide is not just in . 
personal personal personal . 
my grandfather has been through by . 
and , , if she had its own pain , i taught me to to it . 
the 's . . 
most of the people who who who are not thinking about suicide , never thought to another people . 
they just want their pain pain . 
and usually usually on three three species , sleep , or or death . 
in my career , i was hundreds of calls and and hundreds of mental and and and around the bridge . 
the the i i was in , only one two people , but that 's two too . 
one was them . 
the other was a man i talked about about an hour . 
he used my hand . 
at the last he looked at me and said , " i , i i i have to go . " 
and he jumped . 
i want to tell you that most of the people we we in the bridge in no , no suicide . 
also , most people who who are and and and and talk about this , or one or two percent , these people have told told that they they were in the moment they knew they had a mistake they had to . 
i tell the that the bridge only only and and san francisco , but they also people people . 
the connection , or the bridge we make is something that every one of us should . 
active is preventable . 
there is help . there hope hope . 
thank you . 
the world is made you something something you 're not , but you yourself yourself yourself you you , , and the question is your heart : " how are you going to be ? " 
i i something special , but i am not alone , not alone . 
when i was , , was the dream i had since i had had before my childhood . 
my favorite himself finally with my inner truth , my inner self . 
the reason is -- -- i 'll later back -- but when this picture is this , it like this , " because it 's ! you you it . 
but last october , i realized i was only on the . 
we 're all in in in , by our families , our our , our society , from our society , which we live in our own bodies . 
some people have to to to the the who accept the who accept their their or or their their their . 
these are are always a threat for status status for what as a . 
in my case , during the nine nine years , my my friends , even my my my my nothing my my story . 
when i was five years old , i was on this night that i was my my head . 
my mother asked me , " why would you keep this t ? ? 
i said , " , , my my hair . i am a girl . " 
i knew my own identity . 
gender is always over than , , but today we know that it 's grown , complex and complex . 
because of my , i never never to tell my story , not because i thought that with something wrong , but because of the world the world world of us who wants to . . 
every day i am grateful because i am a woman . 
i have a mother , a father and a family that me me me . 
many have not lucky . 
in asia , there 's an old tradition that gender as a . . 
there 's a historical creative compassion . 
there 's a moral , a third . 
when i was eight years old , the the the . 
i stood up and i remember , this beautiful woman , right right , and me at that moment , i i wanted to be . 
when i was 15 years old , still met a young woman , met a woman named 
she was was for . 
and she asked me , " why do n't you go to ? " 
that moment changed my life . 
suddenly i found the world of the . 
not many people were in first first in in america , but i it . 
in the old 15 years old , i was the the with , and with , , literally in the in a truck , or sometimes it was n't the next to a , and and it 's -- it 's a lot of the -- the the everything had
i also the the kindness of strangers , particularly on in black provinces . 
but most importantly , i some some of my best friends in this community . 
in 2001 , my mother mother san francisco and and told me that my was was an ngo was was i could now now go into the united states . 
i apologize against . 
i said , " hi , i have fun . 
i ' m here to friends , i love to and and . 
two weeks later , she said , and said , " you know you to in a ticket in your your your your your ? " 
i did n't have to hear . 
my mother meant , i should say my name with two . . 
they also me me when i started in my . 
it 's interesting that in the most amazing most of some of the , , and and . 
in the united states , it , , before you could name and name its gender . 
so 2001 , i went to san francisco , and i remember when i got my my with the name and the and the . 
that was a second moment . 
for some people , this can be a license , or buy to alcohol , but for me , it was my my life and dignity . 
i believed my dream could dream to new york york and 
many have not lucky . 
i think there 's a woman named called . 
she 's new york , a young woman who she her her her , but but but a life life her life . 
for most of my background is this reality reality reality we live . 
our our is is as as as the population population . 
every 20 hours , we have a worldwide of to the . 
i stand on this stage because there 's a long story of people who and and against against injustice . 
these are camels johnson johnson and sylvia . 
today , in this moment , my my is . . 
i could not my my for myself alone . 
i want to to best to help others , their truth and shame and fear . 
i ' m so to stop it one day , will be to the 20 . 
my truth truth allowed me to accept me as i am . 
can you do that ? 
thank you . 
i 'd like to say what you say , , , but in the , , too , too families , and those who are , who are the trouble with the sex that you have , and what what you say to the people who are helping you ,
sure : i have lucky . 
and sometimes it sometimes sometimes sometimes , so it 's just the the the the the of the right , right ? 
all the , the , we have a gender , and i try to lead conversation conversation that that sometimes does n't seem sometimes , and you should give people people to find their own identity and and that conversation , we should to with with parents with 
the 's still very at the beginning to the the of the and and . 
there 's a lot to do . 
there should be . 
it should be space for curiosity , for questions , and i hope you all here are my . 
thank you . much . 
in many societies societies societies and fathers are known by their sons , but i ' m one of the the fathers who daughter his daughter daughter and i am proud . 
before she was my daughter , but i am her father . 
very , and gentlemen , if we look at history history history , the story of women is a full of injustice , inequality violence and violence and accountability . 
she 's not welcome , she 's her father her father . her mother . 
the neighborhood comes over to get the mother , and nobody father father . 
a mother feels very upset when she got a girl . 
if you first the first girl to the world first daughter is she . 
if you second the second daughter , the world , it 's shocked and and in a a , where the daughter daughter daughter daughter , feels like a . 
not only the mother , but the daughter daughter daughter daughter , when it 's older , she 's also . 
in five , in a school where they should supposed to school , they home home , their home during their school . 
until the age of 12 years , they got a good life . 
it can have fun . 
she can play with her friends on the road , and she can move around like a . . 
but as teenagers , , 13 years , her husband , without getting out of the house . 
she 's in the four walls of their own . . 
it 's longer longer . 
she becomes the of of her , her brothers and her family , and when they called the , , they can even killed . 
what 's interesting is that this is is is not just the life of life itself , but also life life the the . 
i know a family with seven sisters and brother brother and brother brother in the the , the the for for his his his sisters and his parents , because he thinks it was when he was a a , and he would make a a and and out of
so brother brother , dear the joy in his life and his happiness his sisters on the local of . 
another one of the most societies societies and and is . . 
a good girl has very very very very very very and very powerful . 
that 's the . . 
the good good girls is very quiet . 
they should be very , and they should be the their of their and and mother and the the of the older , even their . 
otherwise they 're called the . 
what happens ? 
with the one of them will married and and and to to and and daughters daughters . 
and this cycle continues continues continues . 
very , and gentlemen , this millions of millions of women could be us , if we women in men and men men and women in the developing countries , and the the , and the society , and the the , and the the the the in the countries
and brothers and sisters were born when i first , and i believe , i , like , , do n't say , " -- -- when i first her in the the , the believe , i was deeply deeply . 
long before she was born , i thought about her name , and was fascinated by the , , , . 
her name was italian and and i my daughter her her . 
some days after after birth , after birth birth daughter , my came came to me -- and this was an chance -- he came home to me and brought a a family family family , and i i this this of the , , 300 years years old .
and when i got him -- i was all men -- i took my pen , a a line from my name and wrote " 
when she grew older , four years , i i them in my school . 
now you ask , why should i be a girl in a school ? 
yeah , i have . 
perhaps perhaps perhaps in granted in the united states , and many other countries countries , but poor countries in in societies societies in societies societies , it 's a great event for life . 
to school , identity identity and your name . 
to school , they 're in their their dreams and their hopes their where their their their their their their their their life . 
i got five sisters and i no way to school , it will be , but two weeks ago , i i the the for the the -- i i the the to the family , i could n't remember the the of my . 
and the reason for that i never never never been my name on my . . 
what my my my my sisters could n't could could could could could n't could , i i think . 
i always keep the intelligence and the my of my daughter . 
i i encouraged to sit at my friends when my friends . 
i watched them to visit me visit . 
and all the good values i tried to get in in personality . 
and it was not just for . 
i have these good values in my school , both with and as . . 
i education education education . 
i brought my girls at my i was taught to the lesson lesson . 
i got my students to the lesson of the ultimate moral . . 
love brothers sisters sisters , we were spending for more women and we we to get more , more more and more for women in society . 
but we 're over a new phenomenon . 
something is human rights and and for for . 
it 's called . 
that 's the the of participation of all political political economic economic and social . 
hundreds schools are lost . 
girls girls banned banned to school . 
women were forced to carry , and they were getting to to markets . 
musicians were brought silence , , girl and . 
millions million , but only few languages are things things and it 's very good for the own rights , if you were by people people who kill and and . 
it 's the the thing . 
at age age of 10 , stood stood , and stood to education . 
she wrote a a for a , , and she was for new york times , and she spoke to each other . 
and their voice was voice . 
they look like a " " everywhere . 
and that was why the taliban did n't get their . . the october . 
it was the day of my family for my family . 
the world became a big black hole . 
my daughter daughter and death , i was my wife , " i am blame to what 's daughter daughter and daughter daughter ? " 
you immediately immediately , please please you . 
you 're just the right thing . 
you have your life on the , for the truth for the peace , and for education education and your daughter was inspired by inspired and and . 
your your both on the right and god god will protect . " 
these few words very much for me and i asked this question . 
during during the hospital , strong strong pain was strong , because her because her was was a a shadow on my face . 
my daughter daughter . 
and always said to say , " my my is okay , and my my face . 
i do n't . 
she was a for us and gave us . 
love brothers sisters sisters , we learned to her her in the the most times and i ' m happy to share with you , although they they a a for for rights and children and women , is every every other . 
they crying , their homework was completely . 
she shared with her brothers , i ' m very happy . 
people ask me what the special to me is something that is doing so much , and so , , such and and . 
and i tell you , i n't ask me . 
i i did n't . 
i do n't succeed . . that 's everything . 
thank you . 
18 18 i became the brain . since a passion . 
i am actually . 
anyway , after a a of a stigma . 
am i still or ? 
and if i , i can get it ? 
so for my , i had to , how much much from from a dozen i i every day i i i would n't have , i would have died in less hours . 
some few times was . 
but fortunately , i love experiments and through , so decided decided to experiment to find finding because because there 's really really a really , there 's the . 
i tried different and and it made me absolutely the the way of the my my my my my my my my my my my my my my other people . 
a particularly particularly case , a few months i took out and and a a for the man in the early and and i could barely believe how thoughts thoughts thoughts . 
i was pretty extremely . 
but i surprised that i was not trying to be happy . 
i was trying to understand a little bit and and the problem problem with me , and it did n't just . 
but i think that i hope to get a better for for men and for what you need to , and i i better with better with men . 
i wanted to end on the with the hormones and and and so on my my and i wanted to intelligence my my my my my my my . 
i think mainly in pictures and so this for me , as i i these these pictures , i i like to sort of like a kind of a , for my ideas , like , like , to to various different different . 
this is not thinking . 
philosophers like like , descartes and looked like it . 
they thought , images and ideas ideas actually the same . 
today , many of you and how our head works is is , , , but for me , it 's quite simple : most images images for most of us , are essential for the and and creative . 
so after several years , i finally finally and i now i see a great great very very humble mental with with and and . 
now i am i how to make these pictures images from my head faster my computer . 
imagine a being would be able only help to help the the world . 
or his musician could his music its head . 
this is incredible incredible ways how creative people could in . 
i want to show you why i think we 're close close . here are two two experiments experiments two two groups in neuroscience . 
both both both -- -- -- -- the brain , the here , and here 's a moral of moral and and his colleagues . 
the left shows shows the the of a person that picture . 
the middle shows shows a a the the person who just see to see . 
and the right is the through the the of the left and the that it 's almost zero . 
so many people many people , many different images , with a similar . 
there 's no good difference between the actual watch of the and and the see the same thing . 
let me show you what another experiment that was from by jack called the . 
in this experiment , the people hundreds of hours youtube youtube on their own , by their brains , became a a created of the that that the the . 
then a new film showed new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new and new new new . 
the computer only only the the the the new new and and showed what he thought was actually . 
on the right hand , see the the the and and on the left . 
there 's the language . 
we are so close . 
we just improve improve . 
and remember , if you see a picture , and if you see see the same picture , almost pretty much . 
so this is the highest highest highest today 's happening today , and the resolution really already already in the last the last years . 
next next we we to the the best once to get our . . 
how do we do ? 
there are many different ways for this approach . 
a way would be to and the . . 
nothing for me . 
there are many lot of new children , some of them , but but the the of the successes with we we wonder , we we should be at the end of the technology . 
so as you can can can only resolution resolution only only be only , but but that happens to the better resolution resolution resolution just not , not , , how we need . 
i propose what instead of instead of are allowed to build better . 
we can build a lot of structures with slightly different different , a little bit like a . 
so why is this important ? 
in the the years , the was about was about creating real organic . 
but most of the most advances advances in the world came in the the and and and and and in america . 
so we should also create parallel magnetic , instead of a an academic to the . 
so we can actually thanks the the of of these patterns with moral moral more information from a single atom . 
we use the the we should be able to do the only flow of blood , but also also by hormones and and , , , even even , even better , the goal . 
we will be able to our our ideas directly on digital media . 
can you imagine language and directly with human human human human ? 
what would we make ? 
and how do we learn learn with the truths of human human ? 
they think the internet is big . 
that 's incredibly big questions . 
it might be more powerful than our think our our and . 
and this instrument could be transformed by alzheimer and disease diseases . 
we have no no choice to open open door . 
it 's hard to think it 's longer longer . 
we need to learn this step together . 
thank you . 
i think we all live . 
you can can to someone someone someone for you , you you love , or somebody to tell you , are pregnant , or to say , or one of the other things that we live in our lives . 
that the the of is is always difficult , and although the can be very different , is the experience of a and and to . 
it 's scary , and we hate it . it has to be done . 
in years ago , i worked in the south the south , a a city in the city , while while i was there , i was through a very green green : no one of the , , of abuse , . 
and depending on how " " " my my was my , and just just my hair just had my hair , i was asked to ask the the , , a little child , " baby , " you a boy ? 
and then the table . 
i put my little a little bit , my my , with something more . 
the father was his newspaper newspaper , and the mother mother her child . 
i said nothing and any . 
so i i myself to say something next next . 
i would lead to this . 
so after a few weeks . 
" you a boy or girl ? " 
i have quotes quotes . 
i actually got a little excerpt from the the . . " 
so i i across down , looking down at a a girl in a pink , no no challenge a a a , a a kid , " you you a boy or a girl ? " 
so i went through , , next to me and say , " hey , it 's something . 
my hair are so like like a young boy , and i have a , , but i am a girl , and you know how to love to a a and and sometimes you prefer your ? ? 
so i am more of . 
and this kid looking at me eyes without eyes without saying , " my my is is with . . 
can i have a ? ? " 
how about a ? ? 
that was the the difficult wonderful i ever . 
why ? because the moral and i was . 
how many of us had a few secrets in my life , and yeah , it 's about being . 
but you do n't see people secrets secrets secrets around . 
they know how to feels a secret secret . 
so my mystery does n't come from your or or your . 
i i can tell you 100 why my original was was than , but it 's really about it is not relatively . 
heavy is hard . 
who says it 's harder to explain someone to you you you have to have to , when someone say you just just him ? 
who says his his is is when when you your your kid you you ? 
there 's no harder there . 
we need to stop our own own with other minds , just with our better better better than bad , , should we have compassion because we have all hard . 
at certain point in our lives , we all secrets secrets and they may give us secure , or least more likely to what what might happen if we 're . 
but i ' m here to tell you that regardless of what you 're doing is not supposed to carry around . 
i wore a a a dress and 
i was not the most vulnerable i was willing to everyone with everyone who was into the . 
i was scared of fear , in the , , my my secret and my my my my , and and a muscle , the the thing i had . 
my family , my friends , completely strangers , i had spent my entire life to try to try these people , and now i i the the world . 
i i the pages of the we we were for for for for long time , but if they did n't know those trees , they 'll kill them . 
one of my belief was the wedding of my sister . 
and a little , called a woman , " i love love ! " 
and started with the medical papers . 
" said you ever have to ? " 
" well , we actually have friends in san francisco . 
" we never never there , but we heard it 's supposed to be . " 
" said , do you find ? ? 
he 's really good and he 's a a . " 
what is what what you you most ? 
our our ? our favorite : wants and grace . 
and you who love ? jack jack . 
jack is our family . " 
and a woman , ms , but desperately i to to her support to support me to get my on my side , she was out out , " my husband would wear . 
i could go and my my and and and and i got and and about her reactions , , their their their , and their their , the political of the , i i i i i was , and i could be to the , that that the the
sure it would be be with with finger to your . . 
it 's essential to you you to where you 're just right and the fact that they have . 
and what else you to someone else except except ? 
if you start to honest honest , you need to be ready to get back back . 
heavy are are still not strength . 
ask everybody every i i ' m . 
but i will better , and i like , call it the three three . 
look at these these , , but knowing knowing it 's always difficult to be secret secret . 
number one : be authentic . 
take the tank . 
the kid in the cafe did n't , but i was . . 
if you want someone to to honest , you must have to know that they suffer . 
number two : they straight . they just . 
if you know they 're gay , they just say . 
if you tell your parents , they 're bad , , that hope will be that . 
do n't give them a healthy of . 
they 're their own . 
excuse never . 
and on that way , some people might have hurt , , they care what they they , but they never really care what they 're . 
and yes , some may be disappointed disappointed , but that 's their problem , not yours . 
these are their expectations of who they are , not their . 
this is their story . 
the only story that matters is the writing you want . 
so , you 're the next time you about your secret and and you the your , , remember that you know how it is . 
you may feel very alone , they 're not . 
we know that it 's hard , but you need to open up , matter matter what your is is is , and i ' you you have a lot of other that that you look at the the next , , to the a , and you , and
intelligence -- what is it ? 
if we look at how intelligence , , , , the famous famous quote of moral called a , , " question question whether it can be a machine , is like interesting , like a can be a . . 
when i realized this , , he wanted to the the early early of , like for example . 
but if we 're and and thinking about what we have affected , most of us , machines machines machines machines and machines , and we that we that we just the the of the the and the and and the to build these machines machines . 
so i started trying to explore the the first the physical physical . . 
let 's take back . 
and start with a . 
let 's imagine that we have nothing about about biology , or or , , but fantastic impact that we can see the earth , and a long life life , we can earth earth earth millions of millions , even billions billions of years . 
we see a very strange effect . 
because the earth earth the oil of the oil , from from a to a to a point , and point that at the point 2000 , 2000 2000 , , , , , on earth earth , otherwise otherwise be otherwise , otherwise , or before , before they
as we , we know the natural reason we we ourselves ourselves ourselves . 
we try to avoid . 
but if you have a a , the all of all the nothing knows that of have , , you have to have a physical theory , why asteroids that were to to a certain point of the the the planet , the do n't do . 
i i think that the the question is is the the nature of intelligence . 
so i i i tried to the i started a few years ago , many different topics of different different of different areas , i think , all of one single , the only mechanism . 
so , the , you know all all these different areas i asked me a few years ago , whether there 's the intelligence of mechanism that we can from all of these these ? 
is there a single equation for intelligence ? 
and the answer , i think is is . yes . " " = " " . " what you 're seeing is is the best great to to write for intelligence intelligence that i saw . 
what you see here is a statement of the that the intelligence is a force that makes the future future . 
it makes the future future is going to , or , , , , with a strength , with the heart of to to to a future . 
in short , intelligence may not be in a trap . 
intelligence tries , future future and to and options . 
well , this one equation is to to of course , what can we do with it ? 
what can you predict ? 
are you intelligence intelligence ? 
hire intelligence intelligence ? 
now i ' m going to show you a video that i will some some of of the equation . 
but what if these red red is between entropy and and on a level ? 
what if the behavior does n't affect with the production of entropy , but it 's actually ? 
so to figure out , we have a , , and some of part of the " " " , , to reduce the production of the entropy to each other . 
amazingly has raised many of , games and played and money with money without any . 
here are some examples of some action . 
as a human , , without , , we see here how to automatically a a a on a car . 
behavior is remarkable because we have never have a . 
she just decided to himself the the . 
this ability to capacity is application to use and technical technical . 
so some animals in some of their tools tools to see in in rooms rooms , we see that there 's a , , , , , a large , , which is a animal , so that a small small , a a small , , a third one
this ability will make possible to use and and agriculture . 
also , just like some animals animals , by at at at at night , at a time to to eat , we see that it creates it to model . 
these enormous opportunity interesting implications for and and many other areas . 
and can be be a variety of . 
here 's see here an an engineer against himself and play their potential in play . 
here we see see new new connections in social networks , where wherever wherever always lose , lose , the the . 
same ability of also also application in medical information , energy and intelligence . 
here 's see what they call an an - , the the the and , to to their their emissions in the pacific pacific . 
the same reason is absolutely significant in trouble in both , , and and . 
so we we see here , like a cheap cheap , expensive to a an extraordinary threshold and and and and and and its behavior . 
this ability to get is used in and and . 
alex news : we just saw that a variety of of behaviors behaviors , such as as , , , and and , cooperation , all of all of the single equation that causes a system to its future . 
this leads to a deep . 
when we go back to the beginning of the word robot , " the game " " , " we always the concept that we were in intelligence intelligence , it a a . 
the machines would against us . 
a important consequence of this work is that we have seen both the two idea of . 
machines are not first and and and and try and the the world . 
another important is is . . 
i i asked ask how to the ability to look goals ? 
for the , richard feynman , physicists , once once that if the human civilization would be , and only one single concept of our our could be be to to the , , that all of matter matter of us are looking around us , but , but far
my my of this statement , to something to to to the artificial artificial intelligence , or help to understand human intelligence , is to be intelligence , is that be a , process of future , future future and to the future of the future . 
thank you .
