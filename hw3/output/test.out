i 'll tell you today about the last of the . 
it 's pretty much for 18 minutes . 
it 's a complex , we start directly at a complex place : new jersey . 
because 30 years ago , i met a with with my parents in new york city , and that was my . . 
in my my , the the i i i with my sister . 
between my bedroom and the the was a with with the living room . 
and everybody looked down and looked at night , so i always looked at when i was the the the bathroom , and when i i and and and and , the . . 
and i looked like this . 
i was living , i and i hated . 
i hated this this , i i hated this room and this house . 
and that architecture architecture 
this feeling , my my emotions , that is the power of architecture , because architecture architecture is not about math and and , it 's about the , , , , , we we with places that in . 
and we do n't think that we we , , the [ ] americans americans in in of of of . 
so we 're 90 percent of our time . 
this is enormous . 
it means architecture is us a kind of a that that not aware of us . 
that makes us naive and very . 
and , i i show you a a building building , i know what you think think about " power " " 
and they think that because it 's building building building that has been two years ago . 
this is a trick . 
these this use architects architects to make emotional emotional to forms that we built our buildings . 
it 's a emotional emotional , and we use this for a . 
we were the the 200 years ago . 
we found him in the 19th century . 
we had the same . . 
look at these these , tiny tiny soldiers , the the the the the the 
that 's very useful because because things is essential . 
it 's expensive , it takes it and . 
people build things -- and and governments -- of course , innovation innovation , they use the forms that they are . 
this leads to buildings . 
this is a beautiful building . 
but it does n't have a lot to what what library library 
in the same 2004 , , the the other side of the united and and the looks like this . 
this is in seattle . 
the library is about the digital digital digital digital . 
it 's a new kind of public facility for the city , a place to the and to 
so how is it possible in the same country in two country , both , , different different ? 
architecture is based on a . . 
on one side , innovation innovation is architects of new new technologies technologies new new new new new new new new new , we we as . 
we all all black , , they . . they us , but we 're not dead because we have no choice . 
we need to move the side and symbols symbols that love love . 
if we do that and we 're happy , we feel like like . so so we we again , we we the the the and and that , over the last 300 years years 
thirty years ago , 
so architects architects a the called " . . 
and it concrete concrete . 
small windows , enormous . . 
it 's really stuff stuff . 
when we sat the 1980s , we started these symbols . 
we we back back back the other direction . 
we took the forms that they like , and they . 
we hired and and and and new new . 
and they loved . 
they did n't enough enough . 
we took bought and they them in . . . can be great from . 
shapes became big , and and . 
we were . . 
it was crazy . 
but that was the . , . . 
so was the . . 
that was with symbols . 
they were just cheap cheap because rather places , we we memories 
i know , and i know you know , this is not the . 
this is ohio . 
the the the and and beginning , we started with called the . . 
we looked the historical behind behind behind us , we 're , , and and new forms that that that different forms . 
that was a and exciting exciting , we very , we we it . 
and that would just just back back . 
but then something surprising . 
1997 was building building . 
this is the most bilbao of frank . 
this building changed the relationship of the world . architecture . 
according paul was the most of of the rare moments in the , , and and the public . 
new york times called this building . 
the tourism grew in about two percent after the construction . 
he 's our first good . 
how is it possible that these shapes and wild and radically -- how is it possible to they 
this was happening the the and , and we quickly , us shapes shapes and culture . 
these shapes did us emotional emotional emotional . 
just like in . 
everyone knew that that shapes culture and and . . 
that phenomenon is some some other . 
think about your . 
one hundred years ago , they have to go to the village to to a building . 
the is , , you take a boat , a plane , you 're . 
the technology : you see it in newspapers , in the , until all all the , , the the by the . 
architecture is everywhere everywhere , the the rate rate the the the the . 
because architecture is pretty fast . 
it does n't long long building 
but it takes long building building building , three years four years , and in the , , , , two , or two or other , , , he he the the that the had a years ago , a success . 
this is the most good good architecture . architecture architecture . 
so we have these buildings . 
this will never happen again , i think we we in the in revolution in the revolution of the invention of the invention or the or or . 
according to the theory of the , always , if you 're , , at almost simultaneously , , , of the , , , the and the , , , , , , , , and the , the 
now we can think the the the my own . completely . . 
this is a project we we recently . 
we became more to build this building building . 
this is the center of a city called called in new york . 
it 's a moral . 
we 're a a building building that we we different , and and we , , and our clients , and the , , we , and we a a of of of of of that we on , and the . and and it , , and they ,
it meant two years ago , a was a the community . the the the the the the , 
this building was already part of this community , and in the first summer , people started to and building the building in the , , , a a building building , , it it a medium , because 's , and a of a building , 
so we need no greeks greeks that tell us what we think about architecture . 
we can tell each other what we think about architecture , because the media media have not the relationship between us , , have relationship relationship us and and . 
think about a the in the . 
if the building building today would be , would be to the first online and new new . . 
they would go with experimental , open - , , that the the of the , can . . 
this is . . 
that 's the to you to to the and and the the the the , , , , , , 's 's a a to to to 's a library 
let 's be part . 
this abundance of these experiments are giving freedom their own experiment . 
everything changed . 
architects are not an creatures creatures , the large words and complicated drawings and they 're not the the public -- -- consumers consumers , which is n't nothing . he has n't seen . 
architects can you hear , and architecture not not them . 
that 's the end of the that the future are building very different than the current building . 
it means a public space in the of of , and and in a to of a a city 
a a in brooklyn is a a in brooklyn , not not to sound from from ideas from a . . 
robots robots are to building buildings , because we are for for the to they . . 
buildings buildings , the the the of , , rather different . 
a rural in in miami , florida , can can be place where you can or or or , and , and you can there until . 
that means that not a small small is is for innovation innovation , this little that that the and and and the as , the to . 
so a building does n't be beautiful beautiful to be to be like this this little little building in the where the architects a a hole , with with , , , , , , , , and , and , and , and , and , of , ,
it does n't matter whether a build our buildings , or a robot building building . 
it 's really how we build it it 's just what we build . 
architects know how to build " , and and building buildings . 
we only have waiting for that . 
we 're not longer on on right . 
find a architect , you a architects , design them with us better better better better better better and better better world , because it 's a lot of stake . 
no only not only society society society , they they them to the the the the : the the the where they their their , their and , the the they from the . 
thank you . 
this is my niece , . . 
it was been a year year . 
they 're on this cool way like like , running , a a , after the , my body is too for my legs . 
it looks totally cute . 
and one of their favorite is to look at the mirror . 
she she her her . 
they get , and and yourself yourself these big , . 
when suddenly suddenly n't n't to to his his ? ? 
because we do n't . 
every month would be people to google google , " am i ugly ? " 
this is is . 
and everyone 's wants to just run and and and . 
it 's your something something . it 's something confused , even your your your your her her her , she she says you 're she , you 're 're to say that school is 
because her mother is a a and her friends or something something something , do n't know who you should . 
some of them are so you should not think about them . 
this is a school , healthy girls girls who this this feedback of of the their 's 's . 
well , the teenagers of today are rarely . 
they 're under the , , online and online , and talk , writing , writing , , " , , , , , , , , 
never before we were so so so so , so so , so young . 
one woman said to me , is like every night in the the . 
you just have no . 
and the pressure pressure is the is is . 
this is teaches teaches kids to self - based on the of of of and and the the the the that that . . 
there 's no separation between online and and . 
what real real is , it really hard to say . 
what 's their source of inspiration ? 
you can see the pictures that in the the the . 
perfect with greatness amazing still still . 
and is today . 
and trends like mahmoud , , , , , , and 
by the , , . 
these trends are with with the and and women women women . 
today , you can easily that with girls . 
but the boys are not . 
the pursuit after the and and the the of and . 
but what 's the problem ? 
we want want to to our children to be people . 
but in a culture of culture culture culture , our children to our more and more time and thoughts , the all of of other aspects aspects . 
that 's how their relationships , development and school , . 
six girls do n't make anything because they they do n't . 
and that 's not the activities . 
it 's fundamental activity in their development and and and and to society and the . . 
31 percent , about one three three three , a discussion in classroom classroom , , they do n't do they they to n't to to attention . 
one - five - is not at the . 
if you think you 're not good at or or not , you 're not enough , you average average , you have a n't to about the . 
and that 's all the case in finland . 
and china , and much much how much actually . 
to focus the whole , , it 's about how you you you , and not how you 
funny . 
but it 's also health . 
teenagers with with smart smart less less , less less less and vegetables , eat more than what the and and . 
and it does n't . 
women who think they 're 're -- and again , they 're not whether they 're not -- they 're not . 
17 percent of women would not go to a a when they do n't look at their own . 
think about what that what to the economy . 
if we could overcome what possibilities possibilities . 
this potential is , within the every of of one . 
how do we do ? 
just 's not not us . 
the alone is not enough . 
if we want to move , we need to do something . 
here 's three dimensions : first we teach them . 
we need to help our efforts , develop the , to the the and the . . 
the good news is that there are many programs . 
but the bad news is most most not work . 
i was shocked to realize that the needed the the . . 
we need to make sure that the programs that that children children not , not just a positive , but also have an impact impact 
research shows shows the best best of the first , first the the the , and , friends . 
second , media media and . , the with with with and and and we with with others and and us with us , and look at what , , people , , " , " , " " " and and and and and and and for for .
it 's how to women women and and . about with . 
it 's not okay that we get our our of of of their , , the size of their own , or , , success is a matter of their . 
we need to start them to their actions , and not what they look . 
we can all all to for responsibility for the images and the we we in . 
we can give people people their their and their their and , and for for . 
and i ask you , when did you have a mirror ? 
we need to communities , governments and local and to to something that our our our our our our , and and diversity . 
we need to make people really want to make , , , , in in the the . 
we need to get the stage , because the changes . 
a world where our kids have freedom freedom to the the their of of of , , , , of you you about , they of not , be about , do , are , or what they want . 
bear what this could be in your life . 
a friend ? or the woman just just . . 
what would it mean for you , if you could agree with voice , your your , , , your your , , , , , , , smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller ? 
what would it mean for us , and that so potential potential ? 
today , all us our our our culture . 
let 's say our kids . 
let 's show you that this is just a part of our identity and and we 're love love , what they 're doing what they 're and what they give us a sense . 
first to the curriculum . 
every single one of us should the how we talk about others . 
we 're working communities from the from the to the governments , the the the the the the are are are . 
let 's go . 
in the , , a a a young young in in a , and and a a of of on on the , the the of the . 
i was was from the the of , , , but was to his for for for for his , , he and and he , , to a to new , , , , , , , , , the the 
luckily , these were were by by a . . 
sadly was the first first to the the . . 
i was raised in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , son son was a and and a and and and and , born that the to to to to to . a a 
only when i was seven years , started started to change . 
my father showed me a page of the , just very few people including the majority of the muslims . 
but there 's any religion in every every people who are a little percentage of people who are so so to their their , , they , they have to they in , to to to to to . 
we came to the the without without our knowledge from the fbi . 
day the my last little little little light light on the the the , and the surprise of all , , , the the . 
and he seemed to very laugh to , but i i , a few years later , what they they think . 
they thought i had the same same as my father . 
these men were eventually been up the a of of of pounds pounds of the of of the the the , , the the people . six and and over a thousand other . 
these these were were . 
these men called me " " " " as " uncle uncle . " 
when i was an , we were born for , and these these in in my childhood me me to . 
once i had to get a little bit of , it was time to go the and and into the next city . 
because i was always new new in the , i was the victim of . . 
so i spent the most time time i read books books , or or games . 
so i realized , -- -- to express -- and i was in a in a in a , and was in the to the . 
i was been to to people people to , like their or or their religion . 
so what happened ? 
one of my first experiences that my mindset my work was i was working during the . 
when i was college college , i was to national national in in in . 
the most of my was was , , and i was almost my whole life of the , , this subject of emotions . 
the members of our group came from different different . 
on the first day , i found out that a boy that i was me . 
there had some days days this until this detail came , , and , , that we were n't not natural . . . 
there was people people all and and and and and experience experience my my my . 
this feeling of me me me that the that taught me as a child in in real in . 
i do n't know how to be gay , but i know very good , what it is to to i that of my to control . 
then there was the show show . 
inspiration comes from by , , and the fact that a a black international international international is is better as my is father is not to me . 
one day i had a conversation with my my , , my , and , , and and that i to , that i i i am i . 
she saw me with the eyes eyes of a woman who had been her , , , , , i , " to to people . . 
in that moment , realized , how much negative energy energy is to get to this . 
moral moral is not my name . 
i changed him as my family decided to to my my father my father and a new life . 
so why am i and and feel i in ? 
it 's very simple . 
instead , i my my experience against terrorism , against the . 
i do it for the victims and the , , for the the pain and the , , which in their life . 
i ' m talking about the of these these from the and the of my 
with this , , i ' m living living proof that violence not not in religion religion or and , the the the not not to the the . 
i am not my dad . 
this is a a movie in your head . 
it 's a psychologist , film film . 
he 's 3d with to for all of you you and and and , but the 's just the beginning . 
your film has taste taste taste . 
he has a sense of their body , pain , religious . 
he emotions emotions , 
he 's memories memories , for example childhood that you before . 
and he got a : : the . . 
the the the , , , you can the the . 
the film is your mind of consciousness , how your mind and the . 
consciousness is one of the fundamental elements of human . 
we are aware . 
we all our our own inner , , , and and . 
there 's nothing we 're . 
at my my . . 
i ca n't tell you they 're conscious . 
our consciousness is also the life makes worthwhile . 
we would not consciously anything would have meaning meaning or meaning . 
and the the the phenomenon the universe . 
why are we not robots robots all all all the input and all the the the , this movie ? 
at this point , nobody respond to those questions . 
i say that some of ideas are ideas to to the the of of scientific scientific . 
some claim , a science of impossible . 
science is inherently nature . 
consciousness is inherently from . . 
so can never be a science of consciousness . 
most of the 20th century was this . . 
psychologists our behavior behavior , neuroscientists creates the brain , and nobody else only mentioned . 
thirty years ago , when ted went , , the the the digital scientific scientific . 
about 20 years ago . 
neuroscientists like francis crick and physicists physicists physicists like roger as that that time time to have to to the . 
since this was a real explosion . 
this work is great . it 's great . 
but she also has some basic boundaries . 
part of this work we saw saw seen young young when they were their wonderful work . 
now we we a a a , , the with with the perception of of , or or or pain . 
but that 's still a science of 
it 's not science . 
we know that these interactions with certain species of the , but we do n't know why they do . 
i see that these kind of the of some of the questions to consciousness to look the answers -- the question of what do do do . 
but in some ways , the simple problems . 
nothing against . 
there is no simple problems . 
but the does n't the the the that , this : of this do all the physical processes of the matter ? 
why does this inner , ? 
there , no answer to this question . 
now you may just should just just a few years . 
it 's going to create another interesting phenomenon , like like , , like life , and we 'll explain it . 
the the problems of the of of phenomena the : how how the works , how a a organism organism , and and and , , all of things . 
you could do this human brain brain by by behaviors and functions of human human , , and we we we how we play , , play , questions , questions . 
but when it is about consciousness , ask questions to behavior . . 
if there 's complicated issues , the question is , why all these behaviors are a . . 
in the , the the the the cancer , the the neuroscience is far far far . 
science is , i am in heart . 
i want to make a scientific theory , the works for a long time time , i i a theory of consciousness that totally totally physical , and it works . 
but i had to suggest that that did n't . 
so i think we we a a of . 
we have this wonderful wonderful wonderful , , so it it the the the physics physics physics chemistry explains explains chemistry biology biology biology biology biology biology . 
but consciousness does n't seem to this that model . 
on one side , it is that we are aware . 
on the other hand , we do n't know how to invest our our . 
so i think consciousness is a moment of a kind of that that to have to in our , , but not exactly how . 
and with such a a could be radical radical ideas , and i think we could use two or two ideas that will start crazy , before we do the the scientific in the . 
there are some candidates that this ideas ideas this . . 
my friend dan dan who 's here is one of these ideas . 
he thinks that there 's no problem problem consciousness . . 
the concept concept of the chemical chemical chemical a a . 
we really need to explain the function of the brain , and then we explained everything that . . 
i say just just this this 
that 's the kind of ideas that we need to explore when we find a and and and mathematical of . 
but that view for me and many other other of because they were the existence of human consciousness . 
so i go another one . 
i ' m going to i on two ideas ideas on which that i that i be . be 
the first crazy idea that consciousness is consciousness . 
physicists see some some aspects of the as as : space and time . 
they make fundamental laws based on the , the the of of or the . mechanics . 
these fundamental properties and laws are not about anything . 
they 're seen as a , and in the basis . 
sometimes it 's the the list of the things . 
in the 19th century , discovered found that you can n't see the phenomenon of the fundamental things : space space , , time , , , , , , , , and it 's the the the the and and the , a , , that , . 
i think we 're in the minds of the same situation . 
if you can consciousness the the elements of , , space , , , , , , the the the that the to to the the list . 
the natural consequence would be consciousness consciousness itself as a human to a a human . 
that does n't mean you can n't . 
it opens the way to stop . 
what we need to do is fundamental fundamental that are consciousness consciousness consciousness that , the other , other , space , time , time , physical , . 
physicists sometimes sometimes we need need laws that are so simple to the on the a . 
i think we are conscious in the mind . 
we want to find laws laws that so that you can print them on a . . 
we do n't know yet that are are but we we . . 
the second second idea is that consciousness is be . . 
every system could have a certain way . 
this this is sometimes a a , called " " " everything , " , , , system , not , , , , , , , mice , mice , , , but even , , , , , 
even each has has a a . 
this approach does n't tell that smart intelligent are or . 
a 's is not , , and , , ah , i . 
i never never myself . . " 
no , not . 
but the idea is that maybe may have some kind of , , feeling feeling , a kind of an of . 
it might be a little bit . 
i mean why should someone something like this ? 
part part the the the first that idea that the consciousness is consciousness . 
if it 's an space , space , and and mass , is that it be be be , as they 're . 
you also have to say that this idea that we us , , for people people people , but far less less , is cultures in the , the human . 
an 's motivation comes from the idea that perhaps perhaps and best way to create the fundamental laws between physical and physical , to connect information information information . 
wherever there are there , there 's 
complex models like humans humans . 
simple simple -- simple consciousness . 
exciting is that in recent years , a a , , , that the this notion of this theory has . mathematical mathematical mathematical mathematical . 
he takes a mathematical of of the called called called " to measure the measure in a system . 
and he found the with with consciousness . 
so the human brain , a large large amount of , , a huge level , , , . 
in a mouse , middle amount of suffering , still very high -- very level level . 
but if we go further , microbes , , , , , , . 
the are also , but still than . 
according 's why it 's still still to be the . 
in fact , he was a law law of of , , what , 
i do n't know if this theory is right , but it could be the the theory theory in the science of consciousness consciousness , and it 's the the of a whole series of data , it 's simply simply to to the the the . 
another another thing is that we we us to the consciousness in the physical world . 
physicists and philosophers have realized that physics physics physics 
they describes the structure of reality a a series of of , but they 're not telling about reality reality that that . 
stephen hawking says , " what 's the life ? ? " 
according to the of the , , the the , , , you , , , you you can to the the the the of 
that 's what the physics the to to the power of consciousness . 
so , is the consciousness that the . 
this the , , consciousness not the the of as a . 
it 's in your center . 
i think these major news has changed the potential to change our relationship to , and and that might have some ethical ethical ethical ethical ethical consequences . 
some of them may be intuitive . 
i thought i 'd nothing nothing , that 's a , and therefore . 
if you have the the , you will be hungry . 
i think think about it , might change our view , as what 's from from and and and , is less the of , , , rather than the and the complexity of consciousness . 
it 's also to to find in other systems , like like in computers . 
what about the intelligent system system in the movie , ? 
is it consciously ? 
and you you the , , , , you think they have a certain level of health and and so that should be . 
if the right is , , serious issues are , , both the of economic and and the their to . . 
finally , could have the awareness of , , . 
has canada a personal consciousness ? 
or at the level , a a group of the like the audience of a conference , we just a a a ; ; there a a movie of this individual individual , that of the the the inside of the ? 
i know the answer to this question , but i think they should they be be . 
okay , vision vision is radical , and i do n't know if she 's right . 
i ' m actually the by the first crazy idea that consciousness is consciousness than the second that it is . 
this this raises of questions questions , many many challenges , like like individual parts of the and and complexity complexity of the consciousness that we know and love . 
if we find out , we 're on the right theory of consciousness . 
if not , this is the science of in science and philosophy . 
we ca n't expect to fix it overnight . 
but i think we will ultimately it . 
i think understanding understanding our consciousness is both key to understanding understanding of understanding understanding understanding of ourselves . 
it just needs just really crazy . 
thank you . 
i grew up in a very small town in 
childhood childhood is normal . 
i went to school , with friends friends , my my my sisters . 
it was all normal . 
when i was a a parents , parents , , wanted to help for a for for for . 
my parents said , " well , this is really nice , but there 's a moral problem . 
to to , , , nothing . " 
i went to school , school grades grades , school school school school , little of my school , and spent spent a lot of time , " the the of the and and " 
yeah , i know . 
but they were right . 
years later , while my was in a high school in in , , 20 minutes in the , , and said , , " when do you start with your speech ? " 
" what ? i i know . 
i had 20 minutes about and and . 
he said , " you know , well , your . . 
when someone happened in the , , this person was answered . 
" normally find the . . 
there was a light : this young man had been with with america as a . . 
we we him -- and it ca n't make it . 
many people are not teachers doctors doctors or . . 
we 're not real people . 
and actually , i i sit here on this stage , and i i in the wheelchair , and you expect expect me to me , i , . right ? 
ladies and gentlemen , i have to get . . 
i ' m not here to inspire them . 
i 'll tell you that we were being done when it comes around . 
disability is not , and she does n't matter . 
in the last years , , we these these this social these . 
you probably probably pictures like this : " the only disability in life is a bad mindset . " 
or , " your is is disabled . " 
or before you get , you get . . " 
these are just a few ; there are many many of images . 
you may know familiar with the little girl without the pen in the mouth . 
you may have seen the child that 's on . 
and these images , there are many of call call call . 
i use the word , because because here 's people people to other people . 
you make a objects that can can benefit . 
these images have have to to inspire , , , , , the the and and , " and the my my life is , it might be worse . 
i could be that . 
but what if you 're that person ? 
i stopped counting counting , often often often me me to tell me that they me me , or , , , , and that was before my been . 
i a that that i stand up and i and my my , and , that a human being made . 
all these images are objects objects objects the the . 
so are are there to can you can , and , better and and . . . 
life is disability is fairly difficult . 
we are so . . 
but what we do is not what they 're . 
it has nothing to do with our 
i i with absolutely , the , , i , , the social model of disability , and in the society that we society that in which and our . 
i have been in in this body . 
i love him . 
he 's doing what 's , , and i ' ve learned to use his skills to , as it . it 's . 
nothing do nothing . 
they just use their bodies as well . 
is it really fair to how to can and and how these to are ? ? 
when people say , they 're a inspiration , they want a compliment . 
i know why . 
because of the lie that was was : that disability . . 
i continue to on inspiration inspiration and and , , , , , , , do you you ? " 
yes , 
i constantly constantly from other . 
i did n't know i was lucky . 
i think it 's a great idea to get a a a of a , the the trick the is the the the the the . 
brilliant ! 
we learn from the strength and the of the other not not against our bodies and bodies to a a that that more . 
i think that lie is disability disability disability . 
it makes us life . 
and the quote , the only only in life is a bad mindset , because because it 's not because because of the social . 
you can take the staircase long , you still n't go into . 
it will never happen . 
i want to live in a world where the is the 
in a girl who 's in in her room -- " the the the the , , not as as a , because it 's sitting in the . 
i want to live in a world where you do n't expect so little from the to to the and you of your . 
i want to live in a world where the actual achievement is is , i want to live in a world that was in the in , , in his new teacher in his wheelchair . 
not disability makes us extraordinary , but the our our our . 
thank you . 
what have an objective reality and and empathy empathy empathy ? 
how fast is a " in the air ? 
unfortunately , i just m just one one of these questions , not to . 
most people think of a at a and and and tom tom , he he in the air , but he 's not not . 
it 's something that faster faster than we 're 're , our our , and it it 's because we have to have the technologies , and you you to to of of of , and it 's 's our and and the phone . 
how do we get it ? 
the first step i i was just google google . 
many of you know google . 
you may not know that google is a device that allows you to see see . 
and to what it is to be on on on the field . 
now , you can experience that this i recommend it . 
i have to put it . 
i have to create a framework to use them . 
google can put a can of that , and and and of of of it to to to with things things to and the the and and the the . 
you can experience how it is when they 're on and and and trying to trying to . them . 
i experienced it firsthand , and it feels good . 
here 's the video . 
go . 
open , being is is . . 
i i get closer . 
are you ready ? 
go . 
they have certain that people are missing : the rest of the team . 
we have a video from the university . 
elizabeth : hey , excellent ! ! 
blue blue ! blue ! ! 
oh ! 
that this this experience . 
want to on the field . 
they want to be their , and and i on on youtube , , " , " can you give you a moral ? 
once we experience the experience with with and and , , , we we it it it ? 
what 's the next ? 
the the is is one of the most successful of of , , and that 's not just a . 
and i can show you this video why this is . 
oh ! 
no ! no ! no ! ! ! 
oh my god ! 
so a a man a a and and to 
how will it be him when he at the miles miles miles miles miles miles the mountain mountain 
i think adults adults again . 
but it 's not yet . 
that 's virtual reality . 
how do we go ? 
we do that , if , managers managers and and and that information and , " how do we make our team ? 
how can we win that ? 
teams use technologies technologies to games games . 
they 're to make money . 
a quick story of the . 
forty have invented the very of of their machine that that could sell faster . 
they won the . 
other teams example . 
more people more people . 
we were . faster . 
1994 also the the of the the of with the , the the . 
more people more people who are . 
and new . 
imagine you they to . . . you to the the and and the the next directly directly on your , , you 're already . 
no fear of dying . 
no fear of all all the learning . 
they go out and react . 
and the coaches would like that because you eat eat , , and and . 
they then they . . 
they do n't . 
but he 's not a moral moral . 
he allowed them to to all of data in time to and their . 
how does that ? ? 
a simple simple mechanism would a camera of every corner of the the the the the . . 
they also also the data from the and and the media technologies that 's just working . . 
they have all those data for their players . 
the good teams . 
the bad needs . 
that 's good and bad teams . 
and their their is as as as their , and and is is not for for . 
it 's true . 
how how do that look ? 
imagine you 're . . 
you get the ball . 
they look for free free . 
suddenly was a at a a the her her her , , show that the the . 
usually do n't see him , but he 's the the the . 
they go in . 
another another for 
they throw , but get . 
the ball is control . 
they do n't know where he goes . 
but on the top of the the will , it can . 
he can catch the ball , go . 
the crowd are , and the are are at time and and from every perspective . 
this becomes a new way for . . 
people will get into because they want this experience . 
the want to be on field . 
want to be . 
it becomes part of the because it does n't stop . 
but my question is , is we we using to use it ? 
do we want to use and and , normal ? ? 
i think we can use it for . 
i think we can use it to to the people to people people people by people by someone , someone someone else . 
we know what this technology is worth . 
they tested a high . 
what is this technology of a technology in uganda or , , , the the that to is under the conditions ? 
what is this technology technology , or or or new media , that want to of a , of , , and and and and and and and and and 
ladies and gentlemen , the is reality . 
the questions we ask the choices that we make challenges challenges we are , are , , , , in . 
thank you .

do n't do they do n't have a , or , , they , the , they , they they feel like they do n't , 
just just just , , you may be the the the person person

and finally ended up , " when i " the hospital of san francisco , , they were were . 
boy i had to to that . " 
today 's a a father and a a member of society . 
he was talking about the the and and his depression in the hope that his story . 
suicide is not just in the . 
personal personal personal . 
my grandfather has been the by . 
and , , if she had his own pain , i taught me to to it . 
the 's . . 
most of people who or who who are thinking about suicide , never never thought to another people . 
they just want their pain pain . 
and usually usually in three three , , , , or or death . 
in my career , i was hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of mental and and and around the bridge . 
the the i i was in , only one two people , but that that two too . 
one of them . 
the other was a man i talked about about an hour . 
he used my hand . 
at the last he looked at me and said , " kevin , i ' m sorry , but i have to go . " 
and he jumped . 
i want to tell you that most of the people that we in the bridge , not , not suicide 
also , most of people who are and and and and talk about this , this , one one or , , , have have have that they they in the the the they they they a a they they to . 
i tell the people that bridge bridge only only and and san francisco , but they also people people . 
the connection , or the bridge that we is is something that every every us us . 
active is preventable . 
there 's help . there hope hope . 
thank you . 
the world is made you something you you 're not , but you yourself yourself yourself you you , , the the is in your heart , " how are you going to be ? " 
i i think special , but i i ' not , alone alone . 
when i was , , was the dream i had had i my my before , had . . 
my favorite himself was with my inner truth , my inner self . 
the , is -- -- i 'll back -- but when this picture , this is , , , " oh , it 's ! you you it . 
but last october , i realized i was was on the beginning . 
we 're all in in in , by our families , our our , our society , , we we , in our own bodies . 
some people have to to to the the who accept the their , , or the their their their their . 
these are are always a threat for status status , is is . . 
in my case , during the nine nine years , my my friends , my my , my my nothing my my story . 
when i was five years old , i was on this night that i was my my head . 
my mother asked me , " why would you keep this t ? ? 
i said , " , , my my hair . i am a girl . " 
i knew my own identity . 
gender is always over than , , but today we know that it 's grown , complex and complex . 
because of my , i never never to tell my story , not because i , that i something that , , but of , the the the world world the who who to . . . 
every day i am grateful , because i am a woman . 
i have a mother , a father and a family that me me me . 
many have not lucky lucky . 
in asia , there 's an old tradition that gender as a . . 
there 's a historical business compassion . 
there 's a a , a third . 
when i was eight years old , the the the . the . . 
i stood up and i remember , beautiful beautiful woman , right me , and me , that i , i i wanted to be . 
when i was 15 years old , still met a young woman , met a woman named 
she was was for . 
and she asked me , " why do n't you go to ? " 
that moment changed my life . 
suddenly i found myself in the world . 
not many people were in first first in in america , but i . 
in the old 15 years old , i was the the with , and with , , , , the in a truck , or sometimes it was n't the the to a , and and it and -- it 's the it of the they the the in .
i also the the kindness of strangers , particularly in in black provinces . 
but most importantly , i some some of my best friends in this community . 
in 2001 , my mother from san francisco , and i me that my was was an ngo was was that i could now go into the united states . 
i apologize . . 
i said , " " , i have fun . 
i ' m here to friends , i love to travel and be 
two weeks later , she said , and said , " you know you you in the the your your name your your your your your ? " 
i do n't have to hear . 
my mother meant , i , i my my with my . . 
they also me me when i started 19 in . 
it 's interesting that in the most powerful , of the , , and and and . . 
back in the united states , to to , before you could name his name and his gender . 
so 2001 , i went to san francisco , and i know when i got my my with the the and and the and . 
that was a second moment . 
for some people , this can be a license , or to to alcohol , but for me , it was my my and and . 
i believed my dream could dream to new york york and 
many have not lucky lucky . 
i think there 's a woman named called . 
she 's new york , a young woman who she her her , but but but a life in her life . 
for most of my background is this reality reality reality we live . 
our 's is is as as the population population . 
every 20 hours , we we a a worldwide of to the . . 
i stand here this stage because there 's a long story of people who and and and against injustice . 
these are camels johnson johnson and sylvia . 
today , in that moment , my my is . . 
i could n't my my for myself alone . 
i want to best to help others to their their truth and shame and fear . 
i ' m so to to it it day , at , 20 . 
my truth truth allowed me to me me as i am . 
can you do that ? 
thank you . 
i 'd like to say what you say , , , but in the , , too , , , , and , and those who are the the the with the sex , that that you and , and what you you the to , are you the ,
sure : i i have lucky . 
and sometimes it sometimes sometimes sometimes , so it 's just the the the the the the the , , right ? 
all the , the , , , , and i ' m trying to lead conversation conversation that that the does n't seem to , , , and that you people to to people their their identity and and that conversation , we to to with with with . 
the 's the very the beginning , the the the of the and and . 
there 's a lot to do . 
there should be . 
it should be space for curiosity , and i hope , all of you are my . 
thank you . much . 
in many societies societies societies , are are known by their sons , but i ' m one of the the fathers who daughter daughter daughter and and i am proud . 
before she was my daughter , but i am her father . 
very , and gentlemen , if we look at history history of , , the story of a a full of injustice , violence and violence and accountability . 
she 's not welcome , neither her father from her father . . 
the neighborhood comes over to get the mother , and nobody father father father . 
a mother feels very upset when she got a girl . 
if you first the first girl , the world , the is . 
if you second the second daughter , , it , , and and and a , , the daughter daughter daughter , you feel like like a . 
not only the mother , but the daughter daughter daughter daughter , when it 's older , she 's . 
in five , in a , they should go to school , they home home home , they were in in school . 
until age age , 12 years , they got a good life . 
it can have fun . 
she can play with her friends on the road , and they can move around like a . . 
but as teenagers , with 13 years , her husband , without , not , from the house . 
she 's in the four of of their own . 
it 's not longer . 
she 's the to honor , , her brothers and her family , and when they called the , , , can can killed . 
what 's interesting is that this is is is not just the life of life itself , but also life life the the . 
i know a family with seven sisters and brother brother and brother brother in the the , , the the the his his his sisters and his parents , because he thinks it was when , was a a , , , , and , , , and , and
so brother brother , dear in the in his life and his happiness his his on the the of the . . 
another one of the most powerful societies and and is . 
a good girl has very very , very very and very . 
that 's the . . 
the good good girls is very quiet . 
it should be very , and they should be the your of and and and , and the the of the , , 
otherwise they 're called the . 
and what happens ? 
with the one of them will married and and and to to and and daughters daughters . 
and this cycle continues continues continues . 
very , and gentlemen , this of of millions of women could be , if we were different , and and men men and in in the the and , , the the , , and the society , and the , , and the the the the the in
and brothers and sisters were born when i was , , i i , , i believe , , i , , , " -- -- when i first her in the the , , believe , i was deeply deeply . 
before before she was born , i thought about her name , and was fascinated by the , , , , 
her name was italian and and i my daughter her her . 
some days after after birth , after birth birth , , my my came to me -- and this was -- and he came to to and and and a a family family , and i , and i of this of , , , 300 years years . .
and when i got him -- -- all the men -- i took my pen , a a line from my name and wrote " 
when she was older , , with , , i i i them in my school . 
now you ask , why should i a a girl a a a 
yeah , i have . 
perhaps perhaps perhaps in granted in , in the u.s and many other countries countries , in poor countries in societies societies in societies societies , in a , is a great event for life . 
to school , identity identity and your your name . 
to to school , they in in their dreams and their hopes their they their their their their their their their life . 
i got five sisters and i no way to school , it 's going to but but two weeks ago , i i the the for the -- i i the the the the the , the , , i the the the the . 
and the reason for that i never never never been my name on my . 
what my my my my sisters could n't could could could could could could n't , , i i . 
i always keep the intelligence and the my of my daughter . 
i taught them to sit at my friends when my friends . 
i watched them to visit me visit . 
and all the good values i tried to meet in their personality . 
and it was not just for , 
i have these good values in my school , both both and with . . 
i education education education . 
i got my girls at my i was teaching my lesson lesson lesson . 
i got my students to the lesson of the ultimate moral . . 
love brothers , sisters , we were to to more women and and we to , more more more more more women in the . 
but we 're about a new phenomenon . 
something is human rights and and for for . 
it 's called . . 
that 's the the of participation of in political political , economic and social 
hundreds schools are lost . 
girl was banned banned to to school . 
women were forced to carry , and they were getting to to markets . 
musicians were brought silence , , girl and . 
millions of millions , but only few languages things things and and it 's very , the the the , , , you you have people people people and and . and . 
it 's the the 
at age age of 10 , stood stood , , for , education . 
she wrote a a for a , , she was working for the new york times , and she spoke to other . 
and their voice was voice . 
they think like a " " 
and that was why the taliban did n't get their . . the october . october , and she into . 
it was the day of my family for my family . 
the world became a big black hole . 
my daughter daughter and death , i was my wife , " i am blame to what 's daughter and daughter daughter daughter ? " 
immediately immediately immediately , please please you blame . 
you 're just the right thing . 
you have your life on the , for the truth for the peace , , and , the and , and was by was inspired . 
your your both on the right and god god will protect . " 
these few words are much for me and i asked this question . 
during during the hospital , strong strong pain was strong , because her because her was was , , was a a a . 
my daughter daughter . 
and always said , , , my my is is okay , and my my face 
i do n't . 
she was a a for us and gave us 
love brothers and sisters , we learned to her to in the the and , and i ' m happy to share with you , although they a a the for of and and and , , , is like every other . 
they crying when their homework was completely . 
she was with her brothers , i ' m very happy . 
people ask me what the special to me is something that is doing so so , and so , , such and and . 
and i tell you , i n't what i . 
i i did n't . 
i do n't succeed their . . that 's . . 
thank you . 
18 years ago , i was . the . . 
i am actually . 
anyway , after a a of a a . . 
am i still or or 
and if i can i can it it ? 
so after my operation , i had to , how much of from a dozen i i every day i i i would n't have , i have have 
some times was really . 
but fortunately , i experiments experiments and through , so decided decided to , to find to find because because there 's really a really , to to the . 
i tried different and and it made me absolutely the the way of the my my my my my my my my my my my , my my my . 
a particularly particularly case , a few months ago , i actually and and and chemicals , the typical for a man in the early and and i could barely believe . 
i was pretty . 
but i surprised that i was not trying to be happy . 
i was trying to a a little bit and and the problem before me , and it did n't just just . 
but i think that i hope to get a of this for a and and what and have to , , and i and i i better with . 
i wanted to do a with with the the and and and and on my my and and i wanted to intelligence my my my my my my my . 
i think mainly in pictures and so that for me , as i i these these , , i i like to a of of a , of a , , , ideas , to , like , to to different different . 
this is not thinking . 
philosophers like like , descartes and looked like it . 
they thought , images and ideas ideas actually the same . 
today , many of and and and our our is is is , , , but for me , it 's quite simple : most images images , most of us , are essential for the and and creative . 
so after several years , i finally finally and i now i see a great great very very , mental with with and and . 
now i am i about to can these pictures images from my my own . 
imagine a of would be able to help help help the world . 
or a musician could his music from his . 
this is incredible opportunities , creative creative people in in . 
i want to show you why we 're close close . here are two two experiments experiments of two in in . 
both of both both -- -- -- the the , , , , and a a of of of and and colleagues . 
the left shows shows the the of a person that a picture . 
the middle shows shows a a a the person who just just to see . 
and the right comes from through the the of the left and the that it 's almost zero zero . 
and many people many people , many different different , with a similar . 
there 's no good difference between the actual watch of the and and the the . 
let me show you next another experiment experiment , the from jack lab . 
in this experiment , the people hundreds of hours of youtube youtube youtube , while their were made by their brains , became a the of of the that . the the . 
then a new film showed new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new and new new new . 
the computer only only the the the the new new and and showed what he thought was actually actually 
on the right hand , see the the the and the the left . 
that 's the language . 
we are close close . 
we just improve better . 
and remember , if you see a picture , and if you see see the same picture , almost pretty much . 
so this is the highest highest highest today today , , , the the has really already in the last years . 
next next we we to to the the once to to to . . 
how do we do ? 
there are many different techniques for this approach . 
a way would be to and the . 
nothing for me . 
there are many new of to , , some of the but the the the successes of we we we to , , we we we at the end of this technology . 
so as a can can can resolution resolution resolution only only be only , but but that happens to the just resolution resolution resolution just not , not , , we need . 
i propose here instead of instead of are of . 
we can build a lot of structures with slightly different different , a little bit like a . 
so why is this important ? 
in the the the years , the was was , , , really real . 
but most of the most advances advances in the world came in the the and and and in and . 
so we should also create a magnetic , instead of a an academic , to the . 
so we can thanks the the of of of these patterns with moral moral more more information from a single atom . 
we use the the the , be , not to the only flow of blood , but also also by the and and , , , even , even , even , the the goal 
we will be able to our our ideas directly on digital media . 
can you imagine language and and directly with human human human 
what would we be ? 
and how do we learn learn with the truths of human human ? 
they think the internet is big . 
that 's incredibly big questions . 
it might be more than instrument our our and our and . . 
and this instrument could be transformed and alzheimer and disease . 
we have no no choice to open open door . 
it 's hard to think it 's longer longer . 
we need to learn this step together . 
thank you . 
i think we all live . 
her can can to someone to someone someone first , you you love , or somebody to tell you , , are pregnant , or to , , , or , of the of the that in that in . 
that 's the of is is always difficult , and although though it 's very different , is the experience of a and and to . 
it 's scary , and we hate it . it has to be done . 
in years ago , i worked in the south the south , a a city in the city , and while my time i , through a was a very green , : no , of , , , , , , . 
and depending on how " " my my my was my , and just just my hair just , , , , to , a to ask the , , , , " , , " 
and then the table . silence . 
i put my little a little bit , , my my with with . 
the father gets his newspaper , , the mother her her to a a . 
but i did n't and any . 
so i i myself to say something next next . . 
i would lead this conversation . 
so after a couple weeks weeks . 
" you you a boy or girl ? " 
i have m quotes . 
i actually got a little excerpt from the the . . " 
so i i across my , , and i a a girl in a pink , no no a a a a , a a kid , " a you , a you a a ? " 
so i went through , , let me tell and say , " hey , , it it . 
my hair are so like like a young boy , and i , , , , , a i , and , and , and you to a to and and and and and and your you 
so i am more of . . 
and this kid looking at me eyes without eyes without saying , " my my is is with . . 
can i have a ? ? " 
how about a ? ? " 
that was the the difficult conversation i ever ever . 
why ? because the realized and i was . 
how many of us had a couple of secrets in my life , and yes , it was . 
but you do n't see people secrets secrets secrets secrets around 
they know how to feels , a secret . 
so my mystery does n't come from your or or your your . 
i i can you you 100 why my my was was than , but but it is about it is , . 
heavy is hard . 
who says it 's harder to explain someone to you you you to have a , when someone to say , you 
who says his his is is when when you your your kid that you ? 
there 's no big , there 
we need to stop our own own with other minds , just to with better better better we than , , should we , because we , have we . 
at certain point in our lives , we all secrets and and we may have , , or or more to to what what happen if we we we . . 
but i ' m here to tell you that regardless of what you 're doing is not supposed to carry around . 
i wore a a a dress and 
i was not the most election that was willing to everyone with everyone who was into the . 
i was scared of fear , in the , , , my my and and my my my , and and a muscle , the the the i that . 
my family , my friends , completely strangers , i had spent my entire life to try to try to do , , , and i i the world world 
i i the pages of the we we were for for for for long time , but if they did n't know those trees , they them kill them . 
one of my belief was the wedding of sister sister . 
and a a , , , woman , " i love love ! " 
and started with with the medical . 
" said , you ever ever in ? " 
" well , we actually have in in san francisco . " 
" we never never there , but we heard it 's supposed to be . " 
" said , do you find ? ? 
he 's really good and he never mentioned a . " 
so said , what are you most ? 
our our ? our favorite : wants and grace . 
and you who love ? jack jack jack . 
jack is our family . " 
and a woman , ms , but desperately i to to to her support and to me to me that she was on my was , she , out out of her , , my my , . 
i could go and my and and my and my table and and i thought about her reactions , their their their , and their loved , the political , the , that i i i , and i could be on , , the that that one of the
sure it would be be with with finger to their . . 
it 's essential to you to you where you are just right and the fact that they have . 
and what else can someone else , except to 
if you start to honest honest , you need to be ready to get back back . 
heavy are are still not strength . 
ask everybody , i ' m ever . 
but i will better , and i like , call it the three three . 
look at these these , , but knowing knowing it 's always difficult to be secret secret 
number one : be authentic . 
take the tank . 
the kid in the cafe did n't , but i was . . 
if you want someone to to honest , you must have to that that suffer suffer . 
number two : they straight . they just . 
if you know they 're gay , they just say . 
if you tell your parents , they 're bad , , that hope will that that 
do n't give them a healthy of . 
they 're their own truth . 
excuse never . 
and in that way , some people might have been , , , they they they they they , , they they never what what they 're . 
and yes , some may be disappointed disappointed , but that 's their problem , not yours . 
these are their expectations from who they are , not their . 
this is their story . 
the only story that matters is the writing you want . 
so , you 're the the about of about , , and , and your your , , remember that you know how it is . 
you may feel very alone , they 're not . 
we know that it 's hard , but you you to open up , matter matter , matter is is , , and i and , you you a you of a that of to that the the the , , , to the , , and , , and
intelligence -- what is that ? 
when we look at intelligence , , , , , the the famous quote of , a a , , , , question , it a , can be a , like is , a a . 
when i realized this , , he wanted to the the early of of , , like example . 
but if we 're and and and think about what we have affected of of , , machines machines machines machines machines and machines , we can we that the the of the the and the and the and and the . 
so i started trying to explore the the years the the the physical physics . 
let 's go back . 
and start with a . 
let 's imagine that that that are about about biology , or or , , but fantastic that that we can see the earth , and a long life life , we can earth earth earth millions of of , , billions 
we see a very strange effect . 
namely that earth earth , the to the , , from from a to a to point point , and that the in , about 2000 , 2000 , , , , , , on earth , , otherwise , otherwise otherwise be otherwise , or before , , the
as we know , we the , the , we we ourselves ourselves . 
we try to avoid . 
but if you have a a , the all of all the to of that of , , , , , to a a physical theory , why asteroids that were to to a of point of the the , the do . 
i i think that the the question is the the the nature . intelligence . 
so i i i i to to i and a started , many , many , , of different different of different , , i think , all of of single , , the whole . 
so with the knowledge knowledge out all all these different areas i asked asked a few years ago , whether there 's the the of the the that that we all of these these ? 
is there a single equation for intelligence ? 
and the answer , i believe is is . " " t " " " " . " what you 're seeing is is the the to to to of for intelligence i the . 
what you see here is a statement of the that that intelligence is a force that makes the future future . 
it makes the the future is is , , or , , , , with a , , , the the of to to to a future . 
in short , intelligence do n't like to trap . 
intelligence , trying to get and and and options . 
now , this one equation , to of course , what can we do with it ? 
what can you predict ? 
are you human intelligence ? 
are they artificial ? 
now i ' m going to show you a video that i of some of of of the equation . 
but what if these red red is between between and and on a level ? 
what if the behavior does n't just with the production , , , it it 's it it 
so to figure out , we have a , , , , of the the the " " " , , the the the of of the entropy to the the . 
amazingly has bought many successful , games successfully and played with money with , , . 
here are some examples of some action . 
as a human , , without no , , we see here to a a a a a a car . 
this behavior is remarkable because we never have a . . 
she just simply decided to the the . 
this ability to be to for to and technical technical . 
so some animals in their of their tools , to in in in rooms rooms , we see that there 's a , , , , , a large , , a , , , a a small , , a a a a a , , a , ,
this ability will make possible to use and and . 
also , just like some animals animals , by by at at both time , at a , to to , , that that that it to it . 
these enormous has interesting implications for both and many other areas . 
and can be be a variety of . 
here 's see here of an an against to play play what in in play . 
here we see see new new connections in social networks , where wherever wherever always lose the , , the the . 
same ability of also also has in in , , energy and intelligence . 
here 's what we call an an - , , the , , , , to to their their global in the pacific pacific 
the same reason is absolutely significant in trouble in both , , and and . 
so we we see here , like a cheap cheap , expensive to a an extraordinary , and and and and and and its behavior . 
this ability to be is in and and and . 
alex news : we just saw that a variety of of of behaviors behaviors , such as as , , and , and cooperation , all of of of the the equation that a a system . 
this leads to a deep irony . 
when we go back to the beginning of the word robot , " the game , " , " we always the that that we were in intelligence intelligence , it a a . 
the machines would against us . 
a important consequence of this work is that we have seen the the two - of . 
machines are not first and and and and try and the the world . 
another important is is . . 
i often ask how to the the ability to look goals ? 
for the , richard feynman , physicists , once once if the human civilization would be , , only only single only of our our of our , , to the , , , that all of the matter of us are us are us , , , but but
my my of this statement , to something to to to the artificial artificial intelligence , or help , to human , , , , that intelligence , is that be a , of future , , future future and to the future . 
thank you .
