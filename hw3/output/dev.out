when i was in my , i got my first . 
i was a and studied clinical psychology . 
she was a female woman . 
when i came back first , she had her and and a a . she took in the office office , her her , and her told me she was to to talk about about . 
and i heard that . i was . 
my first business was a a . 
and i got a woman in the who who wanted to talk . 
i i i . 
but i did . 
with the stories , the alex with the , it was easy easy to me simply with the head , while we the problems problems . 
" 30 is the new 20 " , and i i was able to 
work later , later later later later later later later later death later later later . 
people in the and i did nothing as a time . 
but soon , my my , , , to my . 
i hold . 
i said , " yeah , she 's with men with her her , she with with a , but she wo n't marry him . " 
and i said , " not yet , but better better . 
also , the best time to say is marriage is that before they married . " 
that 's what psychologists call a . 
that was the moment that i realized that 30 is the new 20 . 
yes , people were later when they used to than they did n't do . 
alex alex up the the and and we sat and and . 
since i realized that this kind of a has a problem with real consequences , just for and and and her , , but for the , , and all the people in the . 
there 's a million states in the united states . 
we 're talking about about 15 percent of the population , 100 percent if you do n't leave the outcome without being walking . 
watch you when you 're in . 
i want to see you . 
oh , yeah ! you 're all . 
if you get in in the crowd , a , , in the , , i 'll want to see you -- . . 
my my are in the in the , because i think every single one of those 50 million knowledge , psychologists psychologists , and and , and , : the the of of of the and and and the things that you can do for for work for the ,
it 's not my . . 
we know 80 percent of the percent moments in time to 35 . 
that means that eight of 10 decisions , and and and , that out of your life , what it is , until your 30 are already . 
do n't get any . 
that 's will be well , i . 
we know that first 10 years of a a have a tremendous impact to how much money money . 
we know that 30 30 half the americans americans americans or or or the or the . 
we know that brain brain is and and large large in the the the , and and the the the , , whatever means you you might want to change you , now time time . 
we know that the personalities are during the most than than in the life and the the women with their with their their and and that to to be things . 
so in the you should feel about about the bodies and the . 
if we think about the developing of a , we all know that the first five years for years and and in the brain . 
it 's time time that the , life life a a on the future . 
but we hear hear about there there are such such as and and our our our are are . 
but people get n't hear people in the . 
the press spoke about the . 
scientists call the hero . 
journalists for people who are in the the people like " " or " " " 
that 's true . 
as a culture , we have the the critical decade for the . 
public public meant that great things with a a and and little bit little bit . 
right ? 
so what happens when you put somebody in the the head and head says , " you 're 10 10 years to make something out of life life ? 
nothing . 
this person is the and and the . 
and so every day , , people , in the the like like , like your sons and daughters daughters me and me me and say , " i know , my friend does n't good good , but i do n't think about the time . " 
or they say say , " i say , as i learned 30 30 years , my career , is good . " 
but later , it sounds like " my my are over over and i did nothing . 
i had a better than when i had completed . " 
and afterwards it like this : " my my was just like the journey . jerusalem . 
all all around , , fun , and then went to and and and began to . 
i did n't want the only one ; i think i i , i my my , because he was in my 30s . 
where are people in the ? 
does n't . 
ok , that 's easy , but no better , because it 's very much . 
if a lot of the distance is the , there 's a enormous pressure to go into the the fast fast , a city , a city , a partner and two three kids three three . 
many of these things are like and like just now and and and and and everything in in the . 
the does n't mean to buy red red . 
it means you you the career you want to do . 
remember that you ca n't have that child you have to be or or child child . 
too many people in the and and look at yourself and and say , " what i did ? what i i thought ? " 
i want to change what people in the do do . 
this is a story that shows how it can . 
it 's the story . 
i came back to my office when she was 25 because she was it , a an . . 
she said she 'd like to work in in art , or but but not , decided to have thought in the last . 
because the was was , her her her her who was more his his than his its . . 
and even their their hard were were much worse . 
they were often in the the , but they decided and said , " your family ca n't you , but your friends . 
one day , very late at and and almost all hour hour . 
she had a a , and she spent the entire morning , her many , , , but then she looked at the blank place that came up , " in the mind . please please . " 
she was almost , when she looked at me and said , " who will be going to be there ? 
who will going to be cancer ? " 
i moment i had to tell me , " i . " 
but no needed no really needed really really to them . 
i needed a better life and i knew this was her opportunity . 
i had a lot of my , to to , just how much media media were in . 
in the next weeks months months , i got three three , , every every every , whether man or man . 
first , i told , she did n't have a , she 's a a . 
so i i to look you something that would you . 
it 's something that you you a investment investment is something something you want to be next . 
i knew nothing about sexual happy , no no knows how the future of work . but i know , consumers . 
so now the time for this international job , this this this this this that to try to . 
i do n't believe the the the the the but the n't count , who 's not . 
this is enormous . 
i said , " go down , but do what . 
secondly , i think the urban is is . 
good friends are good for to come to airport airport , but , , the the people with people who people like , , , , , , they they , , what they think they they work and they work . 
this new new new new new the the of the outside . 
new things emerge from from " and " friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends . 
it 's true half the 's not or or . 
but half half is not , and weak have have . 
half jobs jobs never have . . so if you give the the neighbors , , you do n't get a . 
it 's not a . . 
the last advice : emma believed that you were n't to family family , but the friends . 
this is true for them as but they would soon soon soon their family when they got a partner and a family family . 
i told her time , family family family , would be . 
you may be thinking that 30 30 is better than than 20 or 25 or and i agree . 
but , you you to you or or , in your life , everybody on facebook is not progress . 
the best time to to your marriage marriage , before you have a a and and means means to be in love love in your . . 
your family family , means , the the and the the , you do n't , it does work , or working with the time that you just . 
so what happened with emma ? 
we went through , and she found the the of a a in another in in another museum in a museum . 
this weak band helped helped to get a work . 
this is why they gave their reason for her to she lived with . 
now , five years later , they 're for museums . 
she has a man who named elected . 
she loves her new and her new family and and she gave me a card , " now , " the the , " do n't n't . " 
sound history sounds like this is but it 's what i love to . 
it 's so easy to help them . 
there are like like planes planes , the the the and and somewhere . 
it 's a a can make a difference make whether difference in alaska or in . 
the applies equally for for , or or , , a great conversation , a great , , a a can can a tremendous impact over over and over and generations . 
this is an idea that all all the reach that you know . 
it 's so just what i said to alex . 
i i the privilege of this same same as the same : the the are not new new , , so you you , a a , , your your your mind , your your family . 
you n't tell you what you do n't know , or did n't . 
you 're just talking about your life . 
thank you . 
in the entire , , our goal to tell us the between between us and digital information that is gap between our world and our world and the world where we can change our imagination . 
and the distance is smaller , smaller smaller smaller smaller and now it 's smaller than a millimeter that 's a a of a and and computers . 
but i wondered , if it could n't matter at all . 
i i imagined what would would like . 
first first i i developed this tool which is in the digital world , so you you put up to the screen , it becomes the physical character . 
designers can your ideas ideas into the in and and can increase on virtual organs under the screen . 
so this tool was the . 
but our hands still still outside the . . 
how can we interact with digital digital and and the whole of our hands ? 
i microsoft , i have , with my with my own , , computer computer and and a small room in the keyboard . 
it 's a little and and and and to the and and face and , and now you can put his hands on the the , the the the and the with the hands . 
since windows and have a position in the the room , can easily easily as a book of a shelf . 
you can walk through this book and and and words words . all of that virtual in the virtual . . 
architects can their models directly with their hands . 
so these two examples we we in the digital world . 
but how would we take the whole time and the digital information ? 
sure many of you already experience to online online online and later . 
but now you worry about worry about . 
here i have " gay . 
you view , you you your your your head or or when the system is the our our . 
that idea idea , i started thinking about the not just not in the space , but they them them , so we can feel it and feel . 
what would a future future ? 
i studied media media with lab with my my my and my my my my , a a . 
well , in this case , this is of a of a of of our world , and that means that computers computers , and people can move anywhere this place . 
effectively have we control the gravity control and motion motion by making us , and and and . 
by creating the object digital , we managed it from the through the through space and time , and can can the human movements , and and in in the world world . 
so can can imagine about thousands of of can be or or michael michael and and in in real world . 
students can use this to build complex concepts and physics and and unlike and , or or or is is is an actual and and experience experience that you can touch and and it 's very powerful . 
and even more than what we 're in in computers computers is is how to change the world that we can change the world . 
as you can can , digital digital information is not only not only something , but to interact with us than part of our physical environment , without ourselves ourselves ourselves from our our world . 
now , we started by talking about borders , but when we remove this border , the the limit limit . 
thank you . 
i was trained for two years to be a a , in china , china . 
when i first in the , the government wanted to school for school , all the . 
but my mother said , " no . 
my parents wanted to engineer engineer . 
after the the , , believed believed that the only way to be good and good job . 
it 's not important whether i did n't like the job . 
but my dream was to become a chinese class . 
that 's me i on my my . 
a has to be very early with the . so i tried to to to to . 
i wrote at the and and the the of a . . 
but adults adults did n't idea . 
the adults adults did it was very serious . 
just my friends were me , but they were only as well as i as myself . 
and at 15 years i knew i was old to to do with the training . 
so my dream would never . 
i fear i was giving my rest of my life just a second . 
but that 's so unfair . 
so i had found to find another another another . 
no one to make me ? 
so i agreed . 
i flew my hunger to my friends with a book about a and and and . and letters , " the the of of " i found my my my , , the the the of the . . 
[ " " " ] " " " the " " " ] , " i was in the united states . 
of course , the china are banned . 
" the earth earth is the chinese . 
it does n't just feel propaganda propaganda . 
the bible is interesting , but . 
but that 's a topic . 
but the fifth made me a kind of " : your father your father and your mother . " 
" i thought , " this is much different than much than . . " 
that was my way and to get me from the to the and to my parents . 
through the new culture of new culture i started reading . 
this includes many . . 
for example , i could n't really map the map because because students students with this . 
never occurred to me that china china not not in the the world . 
a 's a a tells about the personal view . 
the is reading is not . 
the the world is a . . 
there 's even close like african and and . 
comparison and building a complete understanding of 
so i thought , if read reading reading in the , why not in everyday ? 
so i always always two same same same . 
you can ask people people -- " benjamin " by the " ] " by the " ] the the the event , or by friends . 
[ " we call " " [ ] [ ] [ " ] life life " like a " " " ] [ ] ] , i i also the same stories in various -- -- [ ] ] [ ] ] [ ] ] , " from the ,
in were the the the , and political nature . 
at were they were all the nature : nature , fear and social -- 
if you create a , , it also fun to teach the two in two languages . 
[ " for a " " " ] " " the the -- the the of the ] was from me in in the , , i found that i can get . 
so translation , for example , i realized that happiness " " " " " " . " 
" means means means " means " new new . " 
books , me a a . i i have one connection to the people and the past . 
i know i never get more lonely or more . 
a 's dream a dream is nothing nothing compared to what many other other . 
i ' m to to be the only purpose of a a , true . 
his business purpose is to connect us in the , of from our dreams , where our passion and our happiness . 
even a successful dream can be that purpose . 
because i ' m here today , happy , with a life in life and with the most of time . 
they always always with . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
when i was eight years old , a new girl in the grade , she was so amazing as as girls girls always . 
she had a hair and a little nice , , was in in and and . 
in the , i met a front of a . 
so i went longer longer longer , i longer , and i was hidden in the . 
when the air was , i came up into the classroom and i took the . 
and then i did . 
i collected the notes of my , just a few . 
all . 
when i wanted the book , i noticed some some of my other pretty good grades . 
so i i in all all notes , without . . 
i gave all the , and i i was because i was all the time . 
i still still both about my behavior . 
i do n't understand where the thought . 
i do n't understand why i felt so well . 
i felt really good . 
i do n't understand why i never been . 
it was so obvious . 
i was never . 
but most of : : why why am it so so that little girl girl so early in the ? 
nine hate . 
it 's such such , so . 
we know babies babies suffer suffering . 
likewise primates primates . 
we know the north the the for america is in america . 
but i never read a study that their their their their their their their their their . . 
we need to to to the literature , because the novel is the laboratory in the in in all its forms . 
is it an exaggeration to say that if we had no no , , no have no ? 
so no no does no no . . 
no english king , no " from from . 
no shakespeare . 
because the the of of because we , we 're , " " and and " great " , " " " , " " " " " " " " . " 
no no , no no . i i know it 's come to fashion to say that the answer has everything everything but but in in , he really really . 
we year we we 200 200 200 , and the the for the time , and and his of of sexual sexual and and and and , and that 's that we can hope . 
think about how we think about feelings . 
we think about little little boy trying to sleep . 
we think of a piece of cake . 
we forget how how his his vision vision . 
we forget how it is . 
these books books for virginia america as as as . 
i do n't know how bad is , but say , is impressive . 
let 's look why the novel and the the , the and and and so good . 
is it obvious obvious that , , on on -- -- -- -- -- such a foundation basis for a story ? 
i do n't know . i think it 's just hard to because because because think about what happens when we 're . 
when we are , we tell us a story . 
tell tell stories about the lives of other people and they make it bad because they 're so concerned that it 's bad . 
as a narrator of history and the audience we know what detail has to to to to the the the in the . 
he makes us all and and and knew from . . 
so in the first , " in in world , in the , , , the of the , , , to the his and and and like her great , , and suddenly , , , , , so , , , , , they , and so they
everything you told me and i joy else else might even , even even in this moment . " 
this is the story he told himself , and by this , , , , , new new , he he he he he his his his his his his his his his . 
we have to admit that and and and are . . 
veronica friends have have had to have the country to have to with him . 
you do n't have to be so , to stop it hard work . 
volunteer is tedious . 
it 's a amazing emotion . needs to be . 
what are the ? ? 
adam information information . 
volunteer . detail . 
adam , long white hair and small . . 
jealousy . pictures . 
so 's also is successful . 
basically the the of the language of science and the . 
when they found these giant , suddenly , the the the , and the the his his his his , he he this behavior . 
he says , " you think that 's the , but it 's not nothing to form a a text text or a . 
he says , " there 's scientific scientific with active . . 
so , to show us that is is is and look at us , but in in their core , , you 're looking for knowledge , truth truth truth truth truth , and truth truth , and what is happening : the , the better . 
grief , , , , loss -- that 's for for the wisdom . 
he says , " a woman we need to us us , us a a and and and to emotions as a genius genius genius of us who 's us us . " 
does it tell us about that we should look at women ? 
no . i think he tells us to say that us tells us something about ourselves . 
is there another sense that does this particular way ? 
how do we feel our our our our and and and ? ? 
do we feel different with with with ? 
freud should write later . 
one day , a was a very young man named who was thought about him him his his . 
and freud says this man is kind strange strange because he does n't even know what his wife does . 
because she 's innocent , everybody knows . 
the poor creature are under . . 
instead , looking looking for the woman , without without it , , . 
do you very or or you you with a man ? 
[ [ ] says the man says the the of his wife . 
the novel is very good at this point . 
the novel describes very well as our us us , but not exactly . 
because the more we we , the more we get it . 
so i think that 's not us to follow , or things . 
clearly causes us to become very . . 
i i think about eight years , but i also think i ' m also the story i ' ve heard . news . 
a woman woman from michigan was arrested because she from from a a a year , a year ago , died messages . 
a year . 
she tried to the the new her her in the shoes and i i admit , when i heard , i was with . 
because let 's be frank . 
what is , if it 's creativity . 
this is something from a novel . 
this is something from a novel of english . 
consumers is one of my . 
she 's the and and woman woman 's literature . 
from her , two two - of the " " the the mr . " " books , about what about how -- -- how to our minds , and our in our , and in the middle of the , , in the realm of the , , which
suppose tom tom , their sperm character . 
first , he 's going to be and and what they have , and she 's got what they once , and they 're like the , , he 's on their name , he he her their her , he her her her . 
that 's a method . 
what should we do ? we ca n't make tom tom . 
i ca n't give the world world , if i would like to days . 
it 's a shame because we live in a . 
we live in a " . 
we all have good good news social media that which is the . 
show us the novel ? i i m not sure . 
we do what we do when they 're not sure when they 're in a human . 
go to the and and and ask . 
think about people , think about his professor professor professor professor , this this . 
but i always always [ ] because the boss of the with the face of a face , the conservative needs , needs the genius , but it . 
this is so familiar . 
so needs needs his help , and him him and and in the the . 
but when she started to change , and finally , " six six times " as " and and all of the solution , to to up and and says , " we 're not paying on it , mr . 
we proud proud them . " 
and he added that there would no no freedom on the the , not shake the hand . 
this is one of the few times we can see in his stories , and i think these little beautiful very very , but also . 
it seems like a enemy not a , but a dangerous problem . 
one moment is lies on one other other . 
and next moment is on a wavelength . 
suddenly it makes to to that genius genius that he he he he he . 
is it really that easy ? 
what if if if a really a a problem , if it 's about how we we with the other ? 
maybe we would n't accept . . 
we could choose . 
but i love . 
as we wait wait , still still literature literature . 
literature alone . 
literature alone can turn , invites . 
and who 's all : : the good news , the tom tom , the crazy called , . 
we are in society . 
thank you . 
i was about 10 years old and on a a with my father in a in in the york of of new york . 
it was a beautiful day . 
forest forest . 
the sun were like like like like , , if if there was no path , would have been to to that we could the the people that go through this forest . 
we got to . 
i looked at the hut at a cliff and a about a , beautiful lake , me something . 
behind the roof was a a , four four , , , and and and and old . 
i was amazed , angry angry confused . 
the were were to to to care about what they had -- -- who thought , were you after them ? 
the i asked me . 
who 's looking for us ? 
how do you call it or or where " " , " who who are who sitting sitting in in istanbul ? 
who 's behind us in in ? ? or in or in london ? 
here in new york , the the of all tons tons tons tons tons tons tons tons . 
i wanted them to be as as individuals . 
i wanted to understand who job . 
how is it wearing to pick and and those ? 
so i started with a . 
i went to the local , , the and and people in offices and i was a lot of but i was still a . 
i had to go deeper . 
so i took a job as a . 
i only did n't just . . 
and i swam the mechanical and and the snow . 
it was a privilege and a exciting experience . 
everybody asks after . 
he 's there , but not as usual , you think , days days , it 's really bad , you 're really quickly . 
you use the weight . 
i know people who worked this job , whose whose are still still remember the weight that they 're in the body , tons tons of every week . 
there 's the danger . 
after the of the is the public in the the dark , dark jobs . and i learned why . 
you 're all traffic traffic , all over . 
everybody wants and and and the the not not . 
it 's really bad for workers . 
and the trash itself is fully from by the original and . . 
i learned also about the . 
if you read from the and and the the of the city sees a city , you see that it 's like a self itself . 
he keeps stop . 
it 's also a kind of or or . . 
it has always be motion . 
and then that stigma . 
you put the uniform and and , until someone -- whatever reason -- whatever -- because you 're you to traffic traffic with your car , or a a to a in your your , or a coffee in your local , and you 're and and and and say
i think this very special very interesting , because i believe that the employees of the most popular women on the streets of the city . 
they are the public health health . 
if you 're n't cut the trash , every day , and , , he would get rid of the and and the the that we were very much to . 
diseases diseases we had been working for decades and centuries under control , they would and us . 
the economy needs . 
if we ca n't get the old old , we have no place for the new . the motors to the the when the consumption is . 
i do n't agree capitalism i just in the . 
and then that is what i look at average , , , speed speed . 
that 's how i how fast we are . 
we do n't care about our our our our our our our or our our , or to , or . 
we take them , throw throw , forget , forget , because we know people people on the other side that care about . 
so so i want to explore today today how ways we think about think about the stigma and and them into those entertainment how how to create a city , and sustainable and 
work , i think kind of 
you see the streets every day . 
they carry in many cities . 
you know when you expect them . 
and your work makes us ours . 
they 're like a . . 
the the that you you , holding us us ourselves before us before our , , and the and and must must be be to . 
on the 11th 9/11 , 2001 , i was a a of on the street , my little son and ran the the and and there was a man who his his his . 
and i tried to work him his work -- day day day , but i started crying . 
and he looked at me and and just said , " everything 's going . " 
everything will fine . " 
and later later later i started my research over and and met . 
his name is angry and we together together ; eventually we got good friends . 
i wanted to believe that was right . 
everything gets good . 
but in our efforts , the way we we on planet planet species , we have to to to all the cost , including the cost of the . 
and we would be to to to people people who do that work , their experience , how we think about how we can develop systems systems , we can understand what we have to understand what is a positive last of the last 40 years of america and the
philanthropy , we think about when we talk about garbage , power three percent of the national . . 
it 's a remarkable statistic . 
in your life , in your life , if you see the next time you see , job job is to take behind you , take a moment time . 
take a moment , too . 
hello everyone what what ? 
that 's not enough . 
hello everyone what what ?

but one more we found . 
i must say it 's really boring , but before i started , i was a a that that still even . 
now i can stand on my head . 
my parents always always always that i was able to be able to be that was was not a dream , and my dream was , the general general . 
the local of leadership got me a great scholarship on the west , , state university , because every every . 
i was the moral of . 
everybody loved me . 
i did n't just homework the the kids , all my my my , , in in their . 
every time i i from the , " the , , teachers . 
but never never . 
in my , , the the eventually ended up with her " she was in in . . " 
a piece about a girl . 
i was a girl . 
so i went everywhere , i get a role . 
i have a ! 
finally ! finally ! 
thank you , i am finally free ! " 
i did n't . 
business brown got the role . 
i was the the of of , i cried , when someone had my my cat , and she asked why she told me she she was n't . 
i said , " sorry , but if i ca n't do the the , it 's not . " 
i was born for this role and they gave them without without . . 
the life life . 
hollywood is very unusual to physically physically physically . 
after i moved back home , my first role was a in in a . 
my dream became true . 
and i knew i was going to be the " " " to " . " 
but instead , i was a single school that was just the nervous , and realized that that no heart attack , ethnic , an actor . 
they were just perfect people . 
but some simple rule . 
i grew up with the , and both and and , and all these women had one common : they were . . 
so i became . . 
my first job was was to famous famous york city in new york city , and i never never the the of the first ever forget when i realized when he was in the new york jersey with a with a . 
i ' m in in the u.s , i i found across the middle east in arabic , and and . 
some people say i ' m the first major in in arab arab . 
i do n't like the first , but i know you never heard of the bad little baby that women women are n't stupid , and they 're us . 
2003 , my brother mother a mother mother and father , dean , and i with the new york american american now that now now 's now . 
our goal was to the negative image of americans 's the the media and and the first thing that the and and and and not not . 
the was much much much much than the challenge challenge against the stigma of disability . 
my big breakthrough was 2010 . 
i was considered as a " , " to to . . 
i was like the the the , , they me me in a studio and a me with a chair chair . 
so i looked at the and and said , " sorry , can another another ? " 
and she looked at me and said , " five , three , two ... 
and we live . 
so i had to sit at the table of the , i was n't in the the the the the , and when the was was was , i was . 
there was my chance , and i had her , and i knew i had never had to . 
but mr . did n't just me me , but made me a a and and my chair . 
working with keith , i learned something like a : all people on the internet . 
people say kids kids are but but child child or neither never made me . 
in the world wide web , i my my . 
if i look at online , i look at like , " why , why ? 
" stop is the ? ? " 
and my favorite , " poor . . 
did it disease ? 
we should pray . 
even even my my my in the , : , , . 
a disability is so visible as the . 
if a not not n't play , , can can not play . 
the u.n are the biggest -- yes . 
people are disabilities the biggest minority in the world and we are the the in the . 
the doctors said i never never run , but i 'll m here . 
but i would have been media , i would not be . 
i hope we can put a complete picture of media media and media . 
maybe there 's less hatred in the internet if there . 
or not . 
maybe it 's still a a good to to a child . 
my journey with me very very many places . 
i built the red red next to the and and the . 
i was working on a film adam adam adam and and my my , , wonderful wonderful . 
i grew up as a the , " world around . " 
i was the great great in in the national national 2008 . 
i ' ve founded the , , , a a , which is trying to give , moral potential to the the parents parents . 
but the one moment most most most -- most -- -- this -- the moment that most most most , when i was before the man who looked like a a and and a a of of the , and the the as i . 
that was the only time my father ever ever had a poem of me and i i to talk this talk . 
: god god your soul is a dad . my name is my , , " can can can . " 
there was a time we we major problems . 
21 21 , the famous famous from from the apollo apollo and the the sea of the . 
armstrong and machines were alone , but their present on the the was the the of of a heart . 
the was the biggest largest biggest history in the united states . 
to the moon , it 's about about billion billion dollars worth the value , or four percent of the . . 
apollo created jobs for people people and the collaboration of 20,000 companies , universities and entrepreneurs . 
people died , also the first one . 
but until the end of the public 24 people people . 
the 12 that the surface is , is the death of death in the last year , the last year . 
why did they ? 
they did n't take much back : , , , , , and , something that later , later , a new sense of our our our our and our . 
why did you go , you because because president kennedy the the wanted to the his nation better better . 
but every own words of at at school university of a . . 
but , was not just a victory of the the east during the cold war . 
at the time , was a sense of the the forces forces . 
they flew the moon because it was something . 
the happened was a a long series of . 
first first century , the came and the airplane and a and a vaccine against a . 
and the middle century , polio and smallpox smallpox smallpox . 
technology seemed to something to what what was called a a called called " . . 
for the majority of human history , we could n't afford faster faster a horse or a boat or a , but in the , the average of the apollo 10 of a 10 percent of . 
since 1970 , no human beings are on the moon . 
nobody has ever faster than than the the of the apollo , and the the optimism of technology is is great , because the great problems we have with technology with technology , for example , for example , clean clean , , clean energy , or the world ,
i remember remember as a . 
the the 17 17 , and my mother was n't me not very in in the wild of . 
i had a idea that this was be the last , but i was was sure i was going to give it in my life life . 
the 's something something happened with our ability to solve problems with technology , become a tremendous . 
you hear it . 
we have here here at the last two days here . 
it 's a when you have technologists and and and himself with positive objects , with like and and and social media social or social algorithms , the that . 
it 's not wrong with those things . 
they have our lives and personal . 
but they do n't solve the problems problems . 
what happened ? 
there 's a major explanation from the silicon valley where where where you have been less fewer , has been been in in the years , in , in microsoft , and and and . 
in silicon valley , the markets would be the the the , the the the companies . 
silicon valley says that that moved away , ideas ideas ideas and and problems problems problems problems problems even problems problems problems problems . 
but that explanation is not good enough . 
it explains mainly with silicon valley . 
even more likely about little little little little little tiny tiny tiny with a decade within 10 years . 
investors investors has always been to to to energy in energy energy , which is a tremendous successful successful and and development and and , and never never never the development of technologies that are great problems problems without sustainable resources . 
no , the reasons we ca n't solve a big problem , complicated and . 
sometimes we decide consciously not not big problems . 
we could fly mars mars if we want . 
nasa even even a a . 
but mars to mars would be a political choice of of and and it 's never happen . 
we wo n't fly to mars , because everyone thinks that there are there are there are things to be done . 
another time we can solve the big problems problems because our political systems fail . 
today , less than two percent of the earth earth , renewables sources , solar power wind and less , less than two percent , and the reason is is . 
coal and gas are cheaper and wind and cheaper cheaper cheaper cheaper . 
we all want to to the the can can . . . 
now , it 's that , , and and and and all all the the same , which is the national and and international development of evolution of evolution , : a a global global in in and development and and and and and a cost of carbon . 
but in the political political , there 's no hope that the united states or the nation , the by the and and . 
sometimes are common problems , technically technically , but not . 
it was been been the at the on the . . 
but 30 years of taught taught us that the political political are are impact on impact . 
technology can be things like things like systems and transportation and transportation , but it 's going to happen , there are governments . 
ultimately , big problems will sometimes the solutions because we do n't understand understand . 
president , after the war war war war , but found found that there are many types of cancer , which most of the most powerful society against therapy therapy , for only last 10 years , to be more effective . 
difficult problems hard hard . 
it 's not that we ca n't solve problems . 
we can , we need to to , but must must be able to have the four : and politicians and public public must have to solve a problem , solve institutions ; it must have really a huge problem ; we need to understand it . 
the the of became a kind of the for the ability to solve the problems problems , , this . . 
but this is a model which ca n't be in . 
it did n't . 
there 's no fight struggle like cold war , no politicians like john kennedy , who everything everything and dangerous to a a , and not like like the the of the solar system . 
but on , , was just to fly the moon . 
he was only three days . 
and it 's moral whether that 's a problem problem solved . 
we 're ourselves ourselves and the solutions of the future will be . 
god knows we do n't seem to challenges . 
thank you . 
i want you to close your eyes . 
imagine you you stand your your . 
check the door , her color and the material made it . 
now imagine a group of young on your . . 
it 's a german and and you come up and your . . 
you need to really . 
they refused to and and and attention . 
and then they 're directly directly into your . 
bicycles , wheels , all over and and and and in . 
now you can get your your your your your your your your or your or , the the side side of your hand , and the light is like . 
the light seems on . 
it 's you from the of of a . . 
a horse horse . 
you can almost feel how your your your your nose . 
you 'll see the the that in your mouth . 
go on him , in your room . 
here 's your performance to your imagination imagination . 
their clothes were only the the they they called " baby , , " , as they 're on your . . 
now i me your kitchen . 
the soil got through a yellow response and from from their own , , , , , and the and from the " of " , hand hand hand hand hand . 
okay , now your eyes . 
i want to tell you a very important session that year in new york city . 
it 's called " gay . . 
a few years ago , i wanted to call these these as as as as , and the the the . 
it was a bunch and and few few , by very small and and . 
they 're looking at moral hundreds of numbers numbers . 
learned the names of criminals and 
and just poems minutes in minutes . 
they were about who get the the of a a better at the . 
this is crazy . 
these people have have have . 
i started to with with some of them . 
this is ed , , a guy who 's from england and there 's one of the moral . . 
and i said , " ed , when you noticed that you have this special ? " 
ed ed , " i am not a . 
i only have a . 
everybody who here here , you confirm that he 's or just a . 
we all all of using techniques techniques , to to these incredible incredible , techniques that that the the two years ago , invented , the same , , used to learn his talk , and the the to use to learn to learn . 
and i thought , " wow , how i i heard of that ? " 
we stood out and and , , wonderful wonderful , brilliant , and something called something silent , says says to me , " josh , you 're a a journalist . 
do you like ? ? 
i said what ? 
" i 'd like to to to how to make a a better . 
it would the the world that anybody can . " 
i told him , " i ' m not really smart , but you could . 
i mean , you 're somewhere , right ? 
and that was the very strange journey . 
i spent spent a lot of the year i could train my memory , but also to to it and understand how it works it does n't work and what what could be . 
i really know a lot of interesting people . 
this is for example . 
he suffering under the , probably the worst memory . 
his memory is so bad that it 's not remembered to his . . what is amazing . 
though it was tragic tragic , he was in in , how much our our our us to us who we are . 
the other side of the . 
kim bears . 
he was the the for for both of " " . " 
we spent a afternoon together in the public library of in in in , and . . 
and i came back to to a whole of of about memory memory , which was two years ago and and in in in in and and later in the . 
and i really really a really interesting things . 
especially me , there was a time to to memory memory memory memory , to , not almost virtually as as as as today . 
there was a time to people people in their memory , it was . 
so over the last few of we have a a series of technologies -- from the alphabet , , the the , the the , the computer , the computer , the computer that we always always to us to our our our , , the human human human .
these technologies have changed our modern world , but at same time . 
they were changing and and i would argue that they have us . 
without the the , , sometimes seem to remember how how this . 
one of the last places of earth earth where you still find people still find still their own memory , and and and , , is that unique . 
in fact , not unique unique , like like like this around the world . 
and that took me to the the , i wanted to know how these people do . 
a few years ago ago , university university university university a a group of lab . 
they wanted to know is the structure or the brains brains differently than the rest rest us ? 
the answer was no . 
are smarter smarter than we ? 
they gave them a a and and answer was n't . 
there was a interesting and and difference between between the brain of a and and a of the 
when you put it in a and you your brain , as you look at , , faces and images , from the , , you can see that there were the the other of the the than the rest of us . 
it seems like they use the part of their device that used to be used for the . 
why ? can we learn from this ? 
the the to the best memory is by a kind of of every every single technology for a new technology of the and and the rest of the . . 
this is my friend ben . 
on the table before he 's 36 who he he he himself himself an hour with a technique that he invented and and , and . 
he 's a similar technique around the four of four in in a half an hour . 
yes . 
and even though it 's a real techniques techniques to look at things in these these , , all all the techniques on the concept of " psychologists " psychologists " . " 
so so the called this fantastic model of this concept , it 's like : if i two two , please the same word , and i say , " you you that there 's a person called new . . " 
this is his name . 
and i say , " you you that there 's a person who is . " 
if i ' m going to come back to you , and you say , " you know what i said you before you said ? " 
you know what word was ? " 
the person person who was the was , , with the probability of the word as the person who person to person . 
same word , ideas is ; it 's strange . 
what what is going on ? 
well , the name baker does . 
it 's absolutely independent of all the of that keeps your head . 
but the job of the , we know . 
wear wear white white . 
baker have to hands hands . 
rp smell good , when you come home home . 
we even know a . . 
and if we hear the word first , we take that sound with the word and allow it to be a simpler simpler . 
the secret of what in in the in the the and the secret to see better better better better is is to find a way to put the name in the the , and that information that does n't have a , that does n't matter in meaning in a
one of the the techniques can 2 two years back to the . 
she was known as the . 
the story of his walks as well , there was a poet called called who was a . 
he was the conversation because because because if you wanted a big big big , , you do n't have a . , but a poet . 
he 's his his memory in the front of the room room , right right now , the the and behind him and and everybody . 
not just dead dead , your bodies are up to . 
nobody can say who who was who nobody knows where who knows . 
the ca ca n't be properly . 
it 's a tragedy after the . 
and 's out the only one of these catastrophe , he his his eyes and suddenly he he he found his his eye eye , which where where where where . 
and so he 's the the the and and it through the the . 
in that moment , we realized anything we all know all the we know , we , , bad name , name , or or personal our of our colleagues , we can have a very good and and memory . 
i would like to tell the first 10 words to about about , so they would find it hard . 
but i bet you if you would remember remember who who on on a moment on a moment of boring in in your , , you know that . 
the idea of the is to make a building - eye - and and with it to the things -- the the of , , , , , , , , , , , , is is is to to to memory . 
this is a aerial that on over two years old old - across the memory . 
so how does it work ? 
imagine you 're invited to ted at ted , you would mind him memory memory , like like , as would have been , he would have two years ago ago . 
you could call this : imagine you your your . . 
imagine you an absolutely crazy and and story with a wonderful to to remind you that you 're talking about crazy crazy crazy . 
and you go in your house and look at the white on mr . 
and that would remind you your friend ed . 
and if you look like , , you you an anecdote anecdote you you tell . 
you 're in your kitchen , and the fourth thing you talk about was was this strange trip that you go for for a year . and you have some friends who help help you remember . 
so their was was their their -- not word for word , but it was for for . 
the english term " " " " a piece of sentence , comes from the greek word " " " means " 
these are the of than people people and and and in . 
the phrase is first means " first " is to your your . . " 
i found this just fascinating . 
some some more . 
i wanted to to something more about these moral writing . 
but there was a problem . 
the problem that the are are . 
it 's like a group of people who sit sitting and write . 
it 's pretty exciting when someone . 
i ' m journalist , i need something to write write . 
i know the things things in the people of these people , but i have no access . 
so i wanted to tell that story , i had to move . 
and so i began to every every every 15 minutes minutes before i was my my my , my something something . 
maybe poem poem . 
the name from a old sign that i bought on the . 
i had to make fun fun . 
i could never never . 
it 's fun fun because it 's not about the memory . 
you 're just better better and better and get those crazy , , , , , hopefully and hopefully beautiful images inside your eyes . 
i fell . 
here i am with my . 
a couple of and a a that that was two to two little two because the greatest enemy is the . 
i went to the same i i used earlier . 
and i was to remember what only as successful . 
it could be a nice nice for my . 
the problem was that experiment did n't like planned . 
i won the red what did n't have . 
it was nice to talk to and and and and and and and , but that was not what i wanted to . 
these are just tricks . 
tricks work because they 're ideas ideas ideas ideas about making our . 
you do n't want to build anything or or to pay to to the could could the the . . 
we often talk about people with people as though it 's a special effect , but that 's not . 
good are are . 
we make things better when we stop . 
we remember when we 're . . 
we remember , if we have to possibility , why information information and experience and experience for us , why they have meaning and and if we can put them in something that we can in our our culture because we can " the name " " " " 
the , , these are , they 're only shortcuts . 
it 's actually even real . 
they work because they work us . 
they 're us to to and and attention to be in a way that we usually . 
but there are no shortcuts . 
that will happen in memory . 
one thing i want to leave you with the is something that i through . . the man who not remembered to be remembered , , our lives are our . 
how much are we going to spend to our our life life , we we 're looking at our our our our our own our own , , our own , , instead of watching us to us to us ? how much we we are , to how we
i learned that memory , in every one of us to have . 
if we want to live a life , we need to remember the person who remember not . 
thank you . 
at 27 27 , i was a a job in the for a : . 
public public new york york students . 
as every teachers i i tests and and . 
i gave homework . 
the work work , i started notes . 
the the was not the only difference between the best and local students . 
iq did not my students students . 
some of my children are particularly well . 
that 's me . 
what you 're in in in is is difficult difficult : : numbers , bad , the the of a . 
but not 's not that . i was convinced that all my students could learn if they worked and hard . 
after several years later , i came to the conclusion that we were a much better understanding of students and learning from a perspective of motivation , a a psychological perspective . 
what we can measure the best is the iq , but what if in school and life and much more than much and and ability to learn ? 
so i made the classroom and made a professor . 
i started studying and and and in all sorts of different models . i always ask who who is , and why ? 
my office and i went to west west . 
we tried to be the the the the the . 
we went to national school and tried to get children children come come . 
we studied in in very difficult and very difficult , and teachers teachers the the the the the the the , and would would them them the students would pay their students . 
we studied partnerships with and and asked them their . 
and that money would money . 
in all these different different , a a of a . 
it was not social intelligence . 
it was n't good good physical physical and it was n't iq . 
it was . . 
fantastic is passion and highly for for . . 
enormous is enormous . 
it 's is if you 're thinking about a a , or for a week or a month , but for hard to help to help that . 
it is life like a marathon . not . . 
some time began started in public schools schools in chicago . 
i asked thousands of the university of the , , , then then over a year , who was the . 
it turns out that kids have higher higher higher than the the , even if all all of all of like , like like , , tests , even in school . 
so 's matters is not only in in and and , but in school , especially for children children . 
the thing about this topic is me that we know so little science little bit about how to it it . 
every day , i ask and teacher , " how do we do that children ? " 
how do i teach a local ? 
how do you hate for ? ? 
the honest answer : i do n't know . 
but what i know is that you alone n't alone . 
our data show that many lot of people people just their ideas . 
in fact , our is not not is not , but they helped to talent . 
the the best idea i ' ve mentioned about the is is called the . . 
this idea was was at the stanford university of university and and the the belief that the ability to learn to it , but they can change their . . 
dr . doctors showed that if you learn about the brain and learn how to behave as a true and change , much more likely to be much more likely , because they believe n't think that failure is a strange condition . 
that 's is is a great idea for the . 
but we need more . 
here i want to mention my , we 're already . 
that 's the work that lies us . 
we need to ideas our best ideas and and . 
we need to measure whether we succeeded succeeded . we need to be willing to have to to to lessons lessons and learn from scratch . 
in other words , we need need to give our kids . 
thank you . 
in the my my work is the connection to our and and and part of the environment where architecture is natural , local conditions , traditions . 
today i have an example of being incredibly projects . 
both projects are in california , one in ethiopia and one in tunisia . 
they also also that the different perspectives of different perspectives of a wonderful . 
the first example with a invitation , a a of a capital in capital capital . 
this is the kind of building that us us , and and me , as an example of what we should should be . 
first thought i wanted to . 
after we some of these buildings -- there are many of them in the city -- we realized they have three . . 
one is these buildings are empty , because they 're very large , , ca n't afford to buy things . 
secondly , they use energy much because because surfaces surfaces is actually heat heat , and then you takes a lot . 
not a city that should n't happen , because they did pretty bad weather that was between 20 to 20 . 
and thirdly has nothing nothing to africa and ethiopia . 
this is a place with a rich rich rich and tradition . 
and i was at first first , the first of the old market with this these , , thousands of people and and , , at a small . 
it has has this idea of artificial space that uses the to create activity activity . 
so i thought that 's exactly what i really want to do , not a mall mall . 
but the question was how we we a moral system to create buildings . 
the next challenge , when we evolved to us , it 's in a right - of the city where most of the buildings that you see in the picture , not there . 
it 's is two two that have about hundreds of feet . 
first first we create a connection between these two between and and the the the the . 
it turns out in a very moving , which is a a in the building , its its own its own and and . 
in this , we we the idea of a market with small stores that every every every because of the form of change . 
i also also how do we building ? 
i really wanted to find a solution that local people . 
i started thinking about how , an extraordinary from concrete , , the air air , and the light , but in in . 
then i me those beautiful buttons to the . 
they have the properties of a , and helped helped to the entire . . 
we build building these these little little , , the windows , the air lights . 
and this is through these little , , , light light light light from the light to get the building . 
it was n't just simply to with the ideas , because they thought , " this is not an mall mall . we did n't stop . " 
but then we realized that this idea of the is a much more than than the idea of because they can sell sell . 
the the of the was much , much of not just because of the , , but because we do n't have a conditioning . 
so we created some of that we used to to project . 
the first first was to think about how we could build the building better , in a city , almost nearly daily . . 
we created a pigs contribution by walking on the roof . 
under those three , we we us the the of new public space with and and that that that can . 
these these on the roof collect the water in the the . 
hopefully at the beginning , we we the the to to 5 . 
the second example is a huge for 2000 and institutions in 
so , this project project project project that i was ever had to i had to understand the city , but also the environment , the tradition and the culture . 
during these analysis , i ' m looking at the , , is the ancient years old old that that by a wall by , by by , , by almost . 
when i went to the site , the first step to the the streets to the first first , to use with large and features like the in cities and other cities in these other . 
in addition , some some points points dots in the concept of this and and and them with lines and and the creates pattern . 
the last step was about the cell cell , the little cell of the the as the as part of the . . 
what would the best best in in a refugee for ? 
this is the , because of the between between both and that is created and natural natural natural . 
so we have a pattern that the that most most are perfectly in these direction . 
and that 's the result , it 's almost like a combination of and and city . 
there are the layers of layers and in the ground , all these . 
it also the the the that density higher density in the upper and and a a density in the . 
it also the concept of . 
the volume has this form form that itself itself three three different three and , and also also into the into the ground , in the , there are three different species , like a a and a a and a a series of designed that 's activity . 
the roof , my favorite project , this project is the the the the the the the building . 
they can go and neighbors and and , things like a a morning , morning to a building . 
these two examples of shared shared . 
they 're in areas where you can see cities cities . 
in the cities , the the of architecture today and lives lives communities communities communities and growing growing as buildings . 
and i think that 's important to think architecture , but but , solutions solutions that the relationship relationship of the community and the environment and the and nature . 
thank you . 
i want to talk about about and i want to remind you about opinions opinions . 
they are so much that they become . 
i think of my three . 
first one : trust is strong in trust , many . 
goal goal : we should trust . 
and one task : we should trust the trust . 
i think that the the goal and the task on wrong . 
i want to tell you another story about a , a goal and a task that will offer a better approach approach . 
just the : why think that trust trust ? 
and if i know about my argument about this , i do n't know the answer . 
maybe it has some in or some or in in other . 
i ' m . 
but i can look at the of those who that are the the the the believe that trust trust . 
look at a a period , not a much of . 
in the people who were 20 years 20 years ago , mainly journalists and still , still . 
and people people become very very , very very , : : , . 
we 're in the average the the the almost the right . 
but is that good proof ? 
social flexible -- clear -- 
what could you do ? 
so you look at the general mindset of people you ask certain questions . 
trust them ? 
now , somebody else you trust ? 
trust they ? 
trust they ? 
you would you ask , " what ? 
and that would be a response response . 
and if you understand the answer , you might say , " i 'll some some of you , but not . " 
entirely rational . 
in short , we 're in our lives lives trust different different species . 
we do n't have that we we every single or or in a or or two . 
so i could say that i had a certain student of email , the first first to read , , i would n't leave them to . 
maybe i know you know n't even drive your car . 
i suggest that my friend friend a friend should be a , but not that they 're a secret . 
simple . 
so we we can our our how how different can look , why do we we know about trust ? 
the surveys are very bad at the about the , because they use the healthy sense that they thought . 
secondly , we go forward . 
the goal is to trust . 
honestly , i feel . 
i would n't . 
i would try to trust the trust anymore , but not . 
i actually actively active to do . 
and those who who their their hands hands hands hands a a , called the , , , the name , the , , from the dust , " " " " " " " " " " " ] , " " i " i " i " i
" more trust is not a living goal in this life . 
trust management and and should be . 
and then you say , okay , so what 's most important , is not trust , but trustworthiness . 
the most of people . 
and to do that we need to look three three things . 
are they ? ? are they honest ? are they predictable ? 
if we were a person in the the , , and and , find , we have a good reason to trust it , it 's trustworthy . 
but the person is , probably not . 
some of my friends are identical and honestly , i would n't them them any because they 're . . 
i friends , who are very their own business , but they they them around . 
and i am very happy that i did n't have friends friends who are and and , but but . 
if i did n't prove it . 
but after that , we fail , 
trust is response . 
we need to . . it 's hard . 
over the last decades decades , we have potential and all the institutions and and and and , that makes us make their their . 
many of these systems have the . 
they do n't work . 
a was told told me , " the problem is that the takes longer than the baby baby to the world . " 
in our public competition , our institutions , the this problem , this this system should be and and and and , but the opposite . 
it people people like people by their hard to get to . 
happy can contribute contribute . 
so so much . 
the goal is more and , and we 're going to be , if we want to stop and want to communicate , and if we want to other people or or or or , politicians . 
it 's not easy . you have to it it . 
and here . 
as a as a as , the the . 
because it suggests that i and trust trust . 
we can do this for ourselves . 
we can do a little . 
so people people people their their . 
but ultimately is trust by that it 's given by other other . 
you can not make the back to others . 
you have to give you a basis that trust trust . 
so you have to be . 
it 's because of course you ca n't all people people at the nose . 
but they also need to be they they trustworthy . 
how does this ? 
that happens every day . people people doing it , , , , . 
here 's a simple example . 
the store , i my my my , , they me me and ask ask . 
they take them back and give me money back or some of the the in the . 
this is great . i ' you you have to me . 
it 's a important morality . 
and you you to be the , is a very good indication that you you is and you you your your your own belief . 
so our goal is not very hard to see . 
it 's relationships relationships between people , and that 's when and other other . . 
so the moral of of story is much less about trust , or about the trust , which is by by liquid or , and and more more about and and how to people people and useful and simple . 
thank you . 
you know the best best i think i can films films i can . 
i love my own my own my own children , when my daughter four years old , we got together . 
the film has no longer . . 
her her was obviously . 
so she had a good excuse to a a dress and a . 
but if you look at these often enough enough , you see how extraordinary it is . 
we live in today today and our our children in a kind of mental mental . . 
but the chinese was was . 
he did n't follow this . 
it has 40 40 years to this this , , -- -- -- -- a movie movie , a guy , and a guy with a lot of a a a a of the the . 
you know what i talk about , right ? 
right . 
well , there 's a huge difference between these two movies , even several several differences between the the of of " and all the movies that we 're looking . 
first of all , there 's a " of . 
monkeys monkeys are very complex as the . 
but i think if the " of " would have been , would would be said , " " , " you were the the of of that we were . 
use your shoes shoes to make the from computers from the to the . . " 
but it does n't happen . 
another point i i at the most of very very , is that the and and and and and and characters characters characters . 
i first the first time when i was my daughter , star " , " which was later , and the situation was different . 
i had a son . 
he was three years old . 
he was n't invited . 
but he was the second child , he was less less less than his sister . 
so he he , and he 's got the movie film , his his his and his , and i do n't think he understood understood that he was , , but he was certainly quite safe . 
and i wondered what he was there . 
does he make sure that courage or , , and and ? 
did he make that luke a army army to get the government ? 
he he the that there 's only boys in the universe , such an - and of of these who are really cool , but as most of the time , are , waiting , so they can the the with a black and and a , and for him
compare that to the medical 's . 
how do you make your film ? 
by yourself with and and a . 
this is the kind of world that i would like my children would -- -- -- -- -- -- -- not in the world , in the world , in the other words , which is what 's really our world today . 
why is there so much power -- big meters -- -- in the movies that we do for our kids , and so much yellow ? 
there 's a lot of good literature about the influence that movies movies boys boys girls girls , and they should read . 
i do n't read so much about that with with this . 
i know , i know , that that was not not the the model of that i could have able to find through the world of adults and girls boys . 
i think there was this moment with the first thought when i really expected that the because it does a movie , right ? 
i got my mission , i got the girl . 
why are you still there ? 
i do n't know what i do . 
the movies are very on the the the the and and its reward , and there 's not a lot of other and other other . 
it seems almost like when a young is is a a animal , and when you 're a girl , you better better . 
there are are exceptions and and i 'll the the of of each of . 
but they give a message to the boys that the young did not the . 
they 're helping the girls to teach their to to the , , but they do n't show the boys of how they behave . 
there 's no models for them . 
there are some women women who are new stories for our children and and and and and and and and and , and they 're still . 
and the most studio of all times , of course , after another , and every single one of them is a of of a young or or or , or two men , friends , or his son , his son , or two men , a a girl
until , as many of you think think -- this year when she started the movie " -- -- " the of the . 
i him you all . it 's the internet . 
do you remember what the critic said , " consumers ? ? 
" well , i ca n't believe that have a . . 
it 's very good . do n't get that . 
but as none of those movies movies the absolutely . . 
i do n't know if you heard . 
he still not been so much and and meaning meaning , but we 'll be a a . 
and is is a and and in the middle of the famous crisis that she asked with a friend of the the of the films that they had . 
it 's very simple . there are only three questions that you ask : : there 's more than a character in film movie , is a book and something ? 
try to make these difference . 
and these women women at the point of 
and it 's about about what else the the they they the ? 
good ? 
thank you . 
two women , who exist and talk about anything . 
i happen , i saw it , and i rarely rarely rarely rarely in the movies that we know and love . 
in fact , i went into this week , to see a very good movie , " 
you remember ? much more in the , the great , great general , about what a good . 
he falls with with with the . 
i think that should n't , because because of a of of -- i do n't know if you saw it -- but a majority of the of in the message in a message , the men and women and women . 
there are some good places in men in men , in , , , , and , and the great moment of the , is is to a door and say , " you you bed , " 
some some hollywood . 
so let 's look at the numbers . 
in 2011 , the the most interesting people what do you think how many of whom actually actually ? 
11 . that 's not . 
it 's not as many as the number of women we we just in the congress , so that 's good . 
but there is a number that bigger than this is and the this space . 
last year , the new york times published the government government . 
she says . 
one of women women in the united states they killed in their life . 
i do n't think that 's the the ultimate honest . 
i do n't think anything anything anything to do . 
i do n't even have anything and and to do something to do something , but something little thing , and when i hear these statistics , one of the things i think that many of . 
who are these guys ? 
what do you learn ? 
take the story that the the of the a is , the the with violence violence and then the the , which is a woman who does n't friends friends and not ? 
take this story ? 
you know , as a parent , the has a , a daughter , like like , who the same , , we find the world and these statistics very very , and we want to . 
we have tools to the things like " and and hope that will help , but i wonder , if if if they protect protect if we we , at the same time , or , , our , , " 
the moral is a means we we something something very important and i speak here here here . 
i think we need to get our new definition of . 
the definition of the is changing changing . 
they read , the new the the the of of and and . 
they accumulate . 
our sons , our find will find a way to go to new new relationship , and i think we have to show you that a real man is someone , someone your sisters and sisters and and , and on your side and and the the bad bad guys
i think we should look at the to search to find the , if we find them , and look for the the that are that we are the to prove the , that people bring together and bring our sons to and to , and say , " i
when i asked my daughter who was her doctor in " star wars , you know what she said ? 
welcome . 
consumers and and . 
what have these two common ? 
maybe it 's not just the . . 
i think these two characters are experts . 
these are the characters characters in the movie , more than knowing other and other knowledge to share with other people to help them their potential . 
they are are leaders . 
i love this kind of my my daughter and i like this kind of my son . 
i want more tasks like this . 
i want to talk to you in my son son said , " take a and and and , " and more tasks , he should be a team , a team that 's been to to help to help people better people , and better people . 
thank you . 
i want to talk about the story of a . 
i do n't know his name but his story . 
he lives in a small village in the . 
his village is near near . 
the 's the poverty poverty this and . 
when there was nothing , there him , he left his village and went to the city , in this case , the capital , the capital . 
there there there no no no no no no work , no . 
eventually he comes in a a outside of . 
it might be a year , but nothing . 
one day he he by a man who lunch him lunch , then dinner , for breakfast . 
he gave them the young young people and they give him a opportunity . 
he gets a little money to get new new clothes and to money home home . 
he 's young young young . 
finally he . 
he begins a new life . 
his life has meaning . 
a nice day in under under a , , a a . 
this was was was the and and and and and and young young people who were using a . 
how could the story of a a just just trying to fall in the the to that he himself himself into the air ? 
he had . . 
he had to a a , on the future , a a , and it was the first opportunity to show him . 
it was the first thing to call him a a condition called " . . 
and his story repeatedly and the world around around the world . 
it 's the story of the , the , youth , the in in london and london london and something something more than than . . 
young people people from the city , their their , , , , wealth , but young people do n't have a to the prosperity . 
often is the youth that the the . . 
in 2030 , three five five five in cities cities than 18 years . 
if we do n't get people into the growth of cities , if we do n't have choices choices , they will say , " , in the , in the violence , in the and and cities cities . 
in my , , , , suffering 70 70 70 percent of people young people . 
seventy percent do n't work , go to school . 
they do n't really . 
last month i went to the , and i went to the where the hospital where i was born . 
i remember i had this before and i asked , , what would i be surprised here ? 
what if i was to the the condition of " ? 
would i have ? 
i ' m not sure what i should . 
the reason for my young month was in the in the morning of a young boy and entrepreneurs . 
i brought about young young papers . 
we brought together and we a leaders for the biggest challenges . 
a room young man was . . 
he went to the university and he made his . . 
there was no work and no possibilities . 
i remember he told me who had a a , and and and and was the perfect goal , be taught to be and and other . 
they people people like him . 
but that story takes another another . 
in the , the biggest biggest obstacles to come from a b , the streets . 
twenty - civil war was completely completely so that the the best . 
she asked the opportunity and give . 
he left a . 
he started trying to collect the on that they could n't afford otherwise . 
he his friends and he bought 10 10 and he them to , his , sometime over the next three years . 
how does this story story from the other ? 
what makes difference ? 
i think it 's ability to ability to new a new opportunity . 
it 's the general and i believe that the can be against against . 
it 's young people to to create economic economic for them for so . . 
you can be young people to entrepreneurs entrepreneurs . 
i want to talk to you young young who who at one of my meetings : : , , a . 
he helped me the the of the young people who on the summit , and show them how to innovative innovative and entrepreneurship . 
he 's actually the first media ever ever since the ' ve ever seen before until until before , until there were artificial , , were going to the the ship , which when you get to on his wedding . 
if you asked asked , " when you have the last time you you better ? " " the answer was many of the the the the . " 
so an opportunity . 
he founded a low . 
he was a to and and and and and and and and , which which he could be in in the . 
he started to start with flowers , poetry private gardens and businesses around the city and he was working on the first public public in in the . 
there are no public parks . 
he wants to create a place where families and young people and come together , and he says the beautiful things of life . 
just the : he does n't buy a because they too too much water . 
so the first step is to inspire young people and in this room had huge huge impact on the other people in the room . 
they never thought really thought about a business . 
they thought it was working for a working or for government government , but this story , his innovation , had an strong influence . 
he was looking to look their city as a place of possibilities . 
he taught them that they they entrepreneurs entrepreneurs that they could change . 
the day they were innovative solutions for some of the challenges challenges . 
they were solutions solutions for local problems . 
the inspiration young people and the of of a is a really big , but young people need to to their ideas . 
they need social and and they they them to their business business . 
bring you young people who the resources resources , , , give them support support they need to to to ideas and they create create for for growth . 
to me , means more than the consumers of 
it 's about the social effects . 
business do n't just just flowers . 
i think he sold hope . 
his favorite is called when it 's designed to change people 's people . 
the did took the workers to help him to and the and . 
he gave them the chance of the the state of " 
these young companies have a tremendous impact . 
so my my is : : you young people who are , , and and and their their their and and they 'll more stories stories flowers and " and " and " and " and " 
thank you . 
during my childhood , my was my favorite favorite , to to to the the of of my parents , my parents , happiness . 
but these these are are hard . 
they 're from sand to see . 
but after a a , i developed a . . 
i began to see forms and patterns that me me . 
and that turned to a passion finding things to a love for a and and . 
and when i finally started to study , i realized that that my eyes eyes not not n't my eyes . 
suddenly , grew up in my little beach in green , and building miles , and the and the and the the of the cities . 
that led me to talk . 
i had to see different different past in the map . 
let me show you how we see differently differently we use . 
this is a consequence called the eastern border called called . 
and the brown brown brown brown , but we , but and it gets to color , these release suddenly . 
what you see here is the chemical chemical changes the landscape through the and and the old . . 
what i want to share with you today is how we used to used to find a a city that was called names and and for thousands of years . 
and was the the of the ancient , , for years years years , a a called a , , years ago . 
the is is in and and and is very important because it 's a great in a great of of art and architecture and religion . 
and knew that that the the of of los angeles near the national , , from the two , , with the red red , but in this massive . . 
this area is huge -- the four four times three miles . 
the days the the was to and and as soon and moving towards west , , he was the city . 
so you find a a city in a a . 
you might find the equivalent to the needle needle in the face and eyes . 
so we we realized to to map map map of the landscape to see . 
where the the was used . 
but you see more , and this is very interesting to see this easy , , , with the circle that gives us a possible position of the city . 
so we worked with with scientists , we to understand what they can see . 
it 's like dark in the ice , instead of the layers , the climate , , you find the human human . 
in a deep of five under under a under blue layer , we found a solar layer of . 
this is that this possible of for us , in five meters , we we a a hundred hundred years of years , to to middle middle , in the , , the the existence of 
we found both -- -- , , , and and -- that 's a working here . 
it may not look for much but if you look at the the , who moved in the middle of the middle of the , , you find that rocks . 
so we found a density layer of the on of the that 's in the realm . 
we also found evidence for for for for society , which that that this has been a very important city . 
there are no no , , but we will going to go to that street to draw a map . 
what more importantly , we have to do , for young egyptians who who trained in the , so they are the to be great . 
so i wanted to to my my my my middle of the middle of the , , in the city of years ago . 
you know , is the greatest greatest . 
there 's nothing about in . 
ted was not a major b.c . 
but actually , it was a a on a , but a long city . 
you can n't seem to the on the . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
i grew up in taiwan daughter a daughter of my memories memories , my mother mother me the beauty , the and the the of the character . 
i was fascinated by this incredible language . 
but for a , seems seems to be as the great wall of china . 
i the last few years i i asked how i could this this wall , so that everybody has interested in this complex language , and understand understand understand . 
i thought that a new thought method , learn , useful . 
since i , i learned , every single one every every every every every every single in in the . 
in the 15 , i was using new new . 
we only have five minutes to have an amazing and a very useful method . 
a a picture of about . 
they only only 1,000 for for a successful . 
the most 200 200 care them 40 40 percent of the literature literature to enough to to , and and and to understand or or . 
today i i start with eight eight to show you how the method works . 
ready ? 
open your your as as possible . 
it 's called . . 
this guy goes . 
" human . 
if the the for " people people with people poor , if he was , " help ! " "    it 's the the of of the , , but i like this . 
this is a tree . 
tree tree . 
this is a mountain .

next group group eight eight together together 32 words . 
a little can you a few hundred hundred , a a child child . 
if we can that these , we 're them . 
for example , mountain and and fire together the so , " volcano . . 
we know japan is the country of the . 
this is the sun with the , because japan is china . 
a sun of the is called japan . 
a human behind ? 
a japanese . 
the only links left two two left . 
in central chinese means , " chinese chinese chinese chinese chinese chinese political enemies . 
today is an economist . 
a mouth , says says where it says stands for " . . 
that is the slide that i me to the stage . thank you .
