when i was in my , i got my first . . 
i was a student studied studied in . . 
she was a female woman . 
when i came in the , , , was and and and a a . she , the to the , in my , , her her and and and to to , to about . 
and when i heard , i was . 
my first business was a a . patient . 
and i got a woman in the who who wanted to talk about . 
i i get . 
but i did n't . 
with the stories stories , the with the , , , was easy to me to with with the head while we the the problems . 
" 30 is the new 20 , , , i i i was to 
work later , later later later later later later later later later later later later . 
people in the like , and i as nothing . 
but soon my my to , , , , to my . 
i thought . 
i said , " yeah , she 's with men , , her with a , , a , but n't to n't . . 
and i said , " not yet , but maybe you the next . 
also , the best time to to is is marriage that before they married . " 
that 's what psychologists call a . 
that was the moment that i that 30 30 the new . 
yes , people were to when they used to than they did n't . . 
the alex and the the and and we sat and . . 
and i realized that this kind of a a a problem with real consequences with a , , and and , , , , , , , , , , the people in the . 
this is in the in the , people , . 
we 're about about percent percent of the population , , 100 percent if you do n't the the the without without walking . 
watch you when you 're in . 
i want to see some of 
oh , yeah ! you 're all . 
if you get in the in the , , , , , in the , , , want to see you . . . 
my my are in the in the , because i think every single one of these 50 million , , , , , and and , , , the the the of of the and and and , the and that you that you for the , for the ,
this is not my . . 
we know 80 percent of percent of them are in time to 35 . 
that means that eight of 10 decisions , , and and , that that out of life , what it is , until your 30 are are . 
do n't get any . 
that 's will going to , . . 
we know that the first 10 years of a a have a impact on how much money money . 
we know that 30 30 half the americans americans or or or or the or or a . . 
we know that brain brain is and and large large , the the the , and and the , the , , whatever means you you to want to change , , time time now . 
we know that the personalities are in the the than the in the the and the the women with their their their their and and that that to be . 
so in the you should feel about the body and the own possibilities . 
if we think about the developing of , , we that the first five years five years and the and the the . 
it 's time time that the , , , a a on the future . 
but we hear about about there there are such such as and and our our are a a . 
but people get n't hear the the . 
the press spoke about the . . 
scientists call the hero . 
journalists for people who are in the in the like " or " " . " 
that 's true . 
as a culture , we have the the critical decade for the . 
public public meant that great things with a a and and little bit little bit time . 
right ? 
so what happens when you put somebody in the the head and and says , " you 're 10 10 years to make something out of life life ? 
nothing . 
this guy is the and and the . . the it . 
and so every day , everyday , , in in the like like , like , , and daughters daughters me and me and and , and say something like , , i i , , my , but i , , i i the n't . the time .
or they say , " all , i i learned , years 30 , my career , is good . " 
but later , it sounds like " my my are over over and i did nothing . 
i had a better than when i had completed . " 
and afterwards it like this : " my my was like the journey journey . jerusalem . 
all all around , fun , but then 30 was the the and and began to . 
i did n't want the only ones ; i think i i , my , , , was in in in the the . . . 
where are people in the ? 
does n't . 
ok , that 's easy , but no but , it , it 's . 
if a lot of the distance , the , there 's a enormous pressure to go into the the fast fast , a city , a partner , and or and two three in three three . 
many of these things are like and and just just and and and and and everything in in . 
the does n't mean to buy a red . 
it means you you the career you want to do . 
remember that you ca n't have that child you have to be or or child child child . 
too many people in the and and look at at and and and , , , i and what i i ? i i i 
i want to change what people in the do do . 
this is a story that shows how it can . 
it 's the story . 
i came back to my office when she was 25 because she was , , a a . 
she said she 'd like to work in in art , or but but not , decided to have started to the the . 
because the was was , her her her her who who more his his than his its . . 
and even their their hard , , were years . 
they were often in the , , but they said and , , " n't tell you , you , but your friends . 
one day came very late and and and almost all the hour . 
she had a a , and she spent the entire morning , her many , , , but then they looked at the blank place that came up , " " the please please please please . " 
she was almost once when she looked at me and and said , " who will going to be there for 
who will going to me ? 
i moment i had to to to , " i . " 
but no needed no no really really really to them . 
i needed a better life and i knew this was their opportunity . 
i had a to to to , to to , just , , just media media in . in . 
in the next weeks months months , i got three three , , every every every , whether man or or . 
first , i told , she did n't have a , she a a . 
so i me you you you something that would . . 
it 's something that you you a investment investment is something something next next to be next . 
i knew nothing about sexual , , no no knows how the future work work , but i , consumers is . . 
so now the time for this international job , this this this this that that to try to . 
i do n't believe the the the the the but the n't count , 
this is enormous . 
i said to , , , , but but what . 
secondly , i think the urban is is . 
good friends are good to to to to airport airport , but , , the , that people are people with , , , , , , , they they , , they they they and they work and they work . 
this new new new new new the the the the the . 
new things emerge from from " , , friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends
it 's true half the 's not or or . 
but half half is is , and weak , . 
half of jobs jobs never have . . so if you the the boss neighbors , you do n't get a . 
this is not a . . 
the last advice : the believed believed that you were n't n't to family family , but the friends . 
this was like they they but , but but they would soon their family family , , a partner and a family and . family . 
i told her that time a family family , would be . 
you may be that it 30 30 to be than with 20 or 25 or and i agree . 
but , you you to to or or , in your life , everybody on facebook is not progress . 
the best time to to your marriage marriage , before you have a , and and means means to to love love love in your . . 
your family family , means , the the and the the , , , not , , it work , or the , the the that you just . 
so what happened with 
we went through , and she found the the of a a in another in in another museum in a museum . 
this weak band helped helped to get a work . 
this was why they gave their their to who to who with . . 
now , five years later , they 're for . . 
she has a man who named elected . 
she loves her new and her new family and and she me me a card , " now , " , the , the , the , . in 
sound history sounds like this is but it 's what i love to love 
it 's so easy to help them . 
and are like like planes planes , the the the and and somewhere . 
the can can make a a a of the , in or in in in . 
the applies equally for for , or or , , a great conversation , a great , , a a a a of a a and and over over and . 
this is an idea that all reach the the that you know . 
it 's so just what i said to alex . 
i i the privilege the same like that that the the the , , the the new new , , so you you , a a , , your your your mind , your your . 
you n't n't you what you do n't know , or did n't . 
you 're just about your life . 
thank you . 
in the entire , , we always our our goal to tell us the and and and and and we the our the and and and and the , and where we can imagination our imagination . 
and the has has smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller and and and it 's smaller than a millimeter that a a a a and and a . 
but i wondered , what if it 's at at at all . 
i i would like what would would . 
first first i i this tool that which to the the in , , , you you the the the the screen , the the the . 
designers can your ideas ideas into the 3d and and surgeons can increase on the same . 
so this tool was the . . 
but our hands still still outside the . . 
how can we interact with digital digital and and the whole of our hands ? 
i have ve i have , with with my with my own , , computer and and a a little room in the . 
it 's a little and and and and to the and and the and , you can you can your on the the , the the the and the and the with the hands . 
and windows and have a position in the room room , you easily easily a a book of a shelf . 
then you can through this book book and words and words words , all of the virtual . below . 
architects can their models directly with their hands hands and 
so these two examples we we in the digital world . 
but how would we take the whole and and the digital ? ? 
sure many of you already experience to online online online and later . 
but now you worry about worry about worry . 
here i have " gay . 
you view , you a your on your head or or when the system is the our our . 
that idea idea started thinking about the the not just just in in the space , but they them them , so we can feel and feel . 
what would a future future ? 
i studied media lab with lab with my my my and my my my , , a a . 
well , in this case , this is of a a of of our in our world , that means that computers computers , and people can move anywhere this , , 
effectively have we control the gravity control and motion motion by making , , , and and . 
by creating the object digital , we managed it from the through through the and space , and , and can the , , and , and in in the world world . 
so , can can about about of of of or or or michael can and be and and again in . 
students can use this to study complex concepts and physics and and , and , it , or or , , is a real and and experience experience that you can touch and and it 's very powerful . 
and then , just what we 're in in computers computers , is , how to change the that of the change the world . 
as you can can , digital digital information is not only to us , but but with us with us than part of our physical environment , without ourselves ourselves ourselves from our our world . 
now we we started talking about borders , but when we we this border , the is the only limit . 
thank you . 
i was trained to to a a to , a , in china , china . 
when i first in the first the , i to , for the , the . 
but my mother said , " no . " 
my parents wanted to engineer engineer . 
after the the survived , believed believed that the only way to be good and good job . 
it 's not whether i i like the job . 
but my dream was to become a chinese . . 
that 's me how i my my own 
a has to be very early with with this . so i tried to to to to . 
i wrote in the and and the the of a . . 
but adults adults did n't idea idea . 
the adults did n't it it was very serious . 
just my friends were me , but they were only as , as as as i myself . 
and i knew 15 years old i was i was to to to the with training 
so my dream would never . . 
i was afraid that i could rest my rest of my life just . second . 
but that 's so unfair . 
so i had to to find another another . 
no one to make me ? 
so i i . . 
i flew my hunger to my friends with a book about a and and and , and and , , the the 's of 's a , my i a , , the a the of , , the 
[ " " " ] " " the " the " ] , , " , the in the . 
of course , the in in . . 
" the earth earth is the chinese . . 
it just n't n't feel propaganda propaganda . 
the bible is interesting , but strange . 
but that 's a a for another . 
but the fifth commandment made me a kind of a , " your father and and and . . 
" i thought , " this is so much and much than . . " 
that was my way and to get me from the to the and to my parents . 
through a new culture with a new culture i reading . 
this includes many . . 
for example , i could n't really map the map because because students students with this . 
never occurred to me that china china china not in in the the . 
a 's a a tells about the personal view . 
the reading reading is not . . 
in the world world is a a . 
there 's even close like african and and . 
comparison and building a a complete of 
so i thought , if read reading reading in the research , not in everyday ? ? 
so i always always two two same same . 
you can ask people people -- " benjamin " by the " ] [ by ] ] " the the the , , or by the . 
[ " we call " " [ ] [ ] " " " " life " like a a " " of " ] , and i also also the stories stories in various -- -- [ ] ] , ] " from ] , , " from the ,
in were , the the , and political nature . 
at were they were all the nature : : , fear and social -- -- 
if you create a , , it also fun to teach the two in two languages . 
[ " for a " " " ] " " the the -- the the of the the the of in in , , , , i found that i can get . 
so translation , for example , i realized that happiness " " " " " " . " 
" means " means " means " new new . " 
books for me a a , , i i a connection to the people and the past . 
i know i ' m never more lonely or more . 
a 's dream dream is nothing nothing compared to what many other other . 
i ' m to to this the the the of of a , to . true . 
his business is is to connect us in the , , , we have , and our our . 
even a successful dream can be successful . 
because i ' m here today , happy , with a life in life and and , most of time . 
they always always with . . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
when i was eight years old , a new girl in her grade and she was so amazing as a girls always . . 
she had a hair and a little little , , was in in and and . . 
in the , i i front of of , . 
so i went longer longer longer , i longer , and i was hidden in the . 
when the air was , i came up into the classroom and i me the . the . 
and then i did . 
i collected the notes of my , just a few . 
all . . 
when i wanted the book , i some of my other pretty pretty good good . 
so i all all all the notes , without without . 
i gave all the , and i i was because i was all the time . 
i still still more about my behavior . 
i do n't understand where the thought . 
i do n't understand why i felt so well . 
i felt really good . 
i do n't understand why i never been . . 
it was so obvious . 
i was never . 
but most of me : why why me so so that that little girl so so at in the ? 
nine - . 
it 's such such , so . 
we know babies babies suffer suffer . 
likewise primates primates . 
we know the the the the for america is in america . 
but i never read a study that their their their their their their their their their . . 
we need to to to the literature , because the novel is the laboratory in the in in its its forms . 
is it an exaggeration to say that if we had no no , we did n't have ? 
so no no , no zero . 
no english king , no " from the . . 
no shakespeare . 
because the 's of of because we because we 're , " " and and " great " , " " " " " " " " , " " " . " 
no no , no no . i i know it 's come to fashion to say that the answer has everything everything but but in , , really really 
we year we we 200 200 200 , the the " for the time , and and and the of sexual and and the the , , and that that we can hope . 
think about about , think about feelings . 
we think about little little boy trying to sleep . 
we think of a piece of in in . . 
we forget how how his his vision vision . 
we forget how it is . 
these books books for virginia america as as as . . 
i do n't know how bad is , but let 's say . 
let 's look why why the novel and the , the and and and so good . 
is it obvious obvious that , , on on -- -- -- -- -- such a foundation foundation for a story ? 
i do n't know . i think it 's just hard to because because because think about what happens when we . . 
when we are , we tell us a story . 
tell tell stories about the lives of other people and they make it that they they 're so they that it that that . 
as a narrator of history and the audience we know what detail has to to to to the the the 
he makes us all and and and knew . 
so in the first , " in in world , , , , , , , the , , , , to the and and , and and a great , , and suddenly , , , , , , , , , , , they , and so ,
all you told me me , somebody else else else even , even , even in in . . 
this is the story he told himself , and from this , , , , , new new , he he he he he his his his his his his his his . 
we have to admit that and and and are are . . 
veronica friends have had had to country country to to to to with him . 
you do n't have to be so , to stop it hard work . 
volunteer is . . 
it 's a hard emotion , needs to be . 
what are the ? ? 
adam information . 
volunteer . detail . 
adam long made great hair and small . . 
jealousy . pictures . 
so 's is is successful . 
basically basically the the language of the and and . . 
when these were were , suddenly , the the , , the the his his his , he he this behavior . 
he says , " you think that 's the , but but it it nothing to form a a , text or a a . 
he says , " there 's scientific scientific with active . . " 
so to show us that that is is is and look us , but in in in core , , , you , looking for knowledge , truth truth truth truth truth , , , truth , and what is , , the , , . 
grief , , , , -- that that for for the wisdom . 
he says , " a woman we need to us us , us a a and and and to , the the genius genius of of who who 's us . 
does he tell us about that we should look at women ? 
no , i think he tells us to say that us tells us something about ourselves . 
is there another sense that does this particular way ? 
do do we our our our our our and and and ? 
do we feel different with with with ? ? 
freud should write later . 
one day , a was a very young man who who was thought about him his his wife . 
and freud says this this is kind strange strange because he does n't feel what his wife does . 
because she 's innocent , everybody knows . 
the poor creature is under . 
instead , looking looking for his wife , without without it , , . 
do you too or or you that that a 
[ unclear ] says the man to the woman 's 's . 
the novel is very good at this point . 
the novel describes very well as our us us , but not exactly exactly . . 
because the more we we , the more we we it . 
so i think that 's not us to follow , or things . 
now causes us to become very . . 
i i think about eight years , but i also think the ' the ' the ' i ' . 
a woman woman came from michigan , because she from from a a a year , a , , , , a . 
a year . 
she tried to put the new her her in the the the and i i i when i heard heard , , i . 
because let 's be frank . 
what is , it it 's , creativity ? 
this is something from a novel . 
this is something from a novel of english . 
consumers is one of my . . 
she 's the and and woman woman 's literature . 
from her , two two - of the " " the mr . " " , books , what , about how , -- , , , , our and our , , , the in the , in the , , the , , the the , , 
suppose tom tom , their sperm character . 
first , he 's you to be and and you they , , , she 's got , and you 're like the , , he , on the name , he 's , he , , he her her her her . her her her . 
that 's a method . 
what should we do ? we ca n't make tom . 
i ca n't give the world world , if i would like to days . 
it 's a shame because we live in a . 
we live in a " . 
we all have good good social media that that the the . . 
show us the novel ? i i ' m not sure . 
we do what we do when they 're not sure when they 're in a human . 
go to the , and and ask . 
think about people , think about his professor professor professor professor , this this . 
but i always always to , because the boss of the with with a face of a rat , , the , , the , , , it . 
this is me familiar . 
so needs needs help help , and him and and and in the the . 
but when she started to change , and finally , , the six six , " and and and all of the solution , to to up and and , , , we we not not on , , , 
we proud proud them . " 
and he added that there 's no freedom of freedom , the the not shake shake . . 
this is one of the few times we we in stories stories , and i think this little little very very , but but , . 
it seems like a enemy not a , but a dangerous problem . 
one moment is lies on one other of . 
and next moment is on a wavelength . 
suddenly it makes you to to genius genius that he he he he he . . 
is it really simple ? 
what if if if a really a a problem , if it 's about how we we with the other ? 
maybe we would n't accept . . 
we could choose . 
but i love . 
while we wait waiting , we still still literature literature 
literature alone . 
literature alone can make , , . 
and who 's all : : the good news , the tom tom , the crazy called , . 
we are in society . 
thank you . 
i was about 10 years old and on a a with my father in a , in a in the of the york . 
it was a beautiful day . 
forest forest . 
the sun were like like like like , , and if if there was no , , would have been to to that that we the the that that that this this . 
we got to . . 
i saw the little hut on a cliff and a a a , beautiful beautiful , , something . 
behind the roof was a a , four four , , , and and and and old old . 
i was amazed , angry and confused . 
the were were to to to , what what they had -- -- who they , after them ? 
the question me , 
who 's us for 
how do you call it or or where " " , who who are who who sitting sitting in in 
who 's behind us in in ? or or in in in 
here in new york , the the of of tons tons tons tons tons tons tons tons . 
i wanted them to be as individuals . 
i wanted to understand who job . 
how is it wearing to wear and and those those ? 
so i started with with . 
i went to the local , , and and and in offices and and the the , , of a a , , a . still the . . 
i had to go deeper . 
so i took a job as a . 
i did n't just with . . i drove the . . 
and i swam the mechanical and and the snow . 
it was a privilege and a exciting experience . 
everybody asks after . 
he 's there , but not as usual , you think , and days , it 's really , , you 're really 
you use the weight . 
i know people who worked this job , years whose whose are still still the the weight that they 're carrying your body , tons of every week . 
there is the danger . 
after the of the , the the the the the dark , the the . and i learned why . 
you 're all traffic traffic , all over . 
everybody wants and and and the n't . 
it 's really bad for workers . 
and the trash itself is fully from the from the and . . 
i learned also about the . . 
if you read from the and and the the of the city , a city , , that that that it a a a . 
he keeps stop . 
it 's also a a or or or . . 
it must always be motion . 
and then that stigma . 
you put the uniform and and you until see -- -- -- -- -- -- it you 're you to you to with the with , the , , to a a a a , , a , a your your , , you , and and and and and
i think this very particularly - hard , because i believe that the employees of the most of on the streets of the city . 
they are the public health health . 
if you were n't cut the trash , every day , and , , he would get rid of the and and the the that we were to to to . 
diseases diseases we had been decades and decades and under the , , they and . 
the economy needs . 
if we ca n't throw the old stuff , we have no place for the new power , the motors of the economy , the is . . 
i do n't agree capitalism i just in the . . 
and then that 's what i look at , , , , speed speed . 
that 's how i how fast we we . . 
we do n't care about our our our our our our our or our our , , , , . 
we take them , throw them , forget , because because we know people people on the other side that care about . 
so so i want to explore today a ways of we we about about the the the and and them them into , how , to to a a , and sustainable and 
work , i think is is 
they see the streets every day . 
they carry in many cities . 
you know when you expect them . 
and your work makes us ours . 
they 're like a . . 
the the that you you , , us us ourselves before us before our , , and the and and must must be be to . 
on the 11th 9/11 , 2001 , i was a a of on the street , my little son and and the the and and was was a man who his his his , 
and i tried to work him his work -- day day day day , but i started . 
and he looked at me and and just said , " everything is 's . " 
everything will fine . " 
and later later , i started my research and and and met . 
his name is ivan and we were together together ; we we good friends . 
i wanted to believe that was right . 
everything gets . . 
but in our efforts , the way we we in this planet species , , to to to the all the cost , including the the of . 
and we have to to to to people do that do , work , their experience , how we think about how we can we , systems , we that that of we a to the last of the , the of , and the world , and the ,
philanthropy , we think think about about , about three percent of the national world . 
it 's a remarkable statistic . 
in your everyday , in your life , if you see the next time you see , is job is to take , and , a , you . 
take a moment , too .

they were just perfect people . 
but even think the rule . 
i grew up with the , and both and and , all these women , one they : . . 
so i became . . 
my first job was was to famous famous new new in in in new , and , never never the the of the first ever i i , when when he was that the in the the to a with a with a .

2003 , my brother from a mother and father , dean , and i with the new york american american now , now now is now . 
our goal was to to the negative of of americans , the the media and and the first thing that the and and and are not . . 
the was much much much much than the challenge challenge against the stigma of disability . 
my big breakthrough was 2010 . 
i was considered as a " , " to . . . 
i was like to the music , , they me me in a studio and a me a a chair chair . 
so i looked at the and and said , " sorry , can another another ? " 
and she looked at me and said , " five , four , two ... 
and we were ! 
so i had to sit the the the the , , i was not the the the the the the , and the the was was was , 
there was my chance , and i had her , and i knew i had never had to again . 
mr . did invited me me me , but but me a a and and my my chair . 
working with keith , i learned something like a : all people are the internet . 
people say kids are cruel , but child child , neither never made me . 
in the world wide web , i my my . 
if i look at online , i look at like , " why , why ? 
" 's is the ? ? " 
and my favorite , " poor . . 
did it accept ? 
we should pray them . 
even even my my in the , , , , , . 
a disability is as visible as the . 
if a not not n't play , , n't n't a . . 
the u.n are the biggest -- yes . this is a . value . 
people are disabilities the biggest minority in the world and we are the the in the . 
the doctors said i never never run , but i 'll m here . 
but i was media with media , i would not be . 
i hope we can put a complete picture of media media and media . 
maybe there 's less less in the internet when it makes more positive . 
or not . 
maybe it 's still a a to to a child . 
my journey with me a very very special places . 
i sit to the red next to the and and the . 
i was working with adam adam adam adam , and and my my , wonderful wonderful . . 
i grew up with the mall , " world the . . 
i was the great great in in the national national . 
i ' ve " the , , , , a , which is trying to give , moral of the the the parents parents . 
but one one moment most most most -- -- this -- -- -- the moment that most most , , i i the the the who was the , the a and and a a and the the , and the the , , . 
that was the only time my father ever ever found me a , and i i to to talk . 
: god god your soul is , , . . my name is , , , " can can can . " 
there was a time we we were major problems . 
21 21 , the famous from from from the apollo apollo and the the sea of the . 
armstrong and machines were alone , but their present on the the was the the of of a heart , 
the was the biggest largest in in history the . 
to the moon , it 's about about billion billion dollars worth the value , or four percent of the . . 
apollo created jobs for people people and the collaboration of 20,000 companies , universities and entrepreneurs . 
people died , also the first one . 
but until the end of the public , people people people . 
from the 12 that made is , , the the death , the the last year , the last year . 
why why did they ? 
they did n't take much back : , , , , , and , something that all , later , a new sense of our our and our 
why did you go ? well , because president president the the wanted to , his nation had better . 
but every own words of at at the university of a . . 
for , apollo , not a victory of the the the the the during the cold war . 
at the time , was was a sense of the the forces forces . 
they flew to the because because was something . 
the happened was a a long series of . 
first first century , the , the the the and the , , and a vaccine against tuberculosis . 
and the middle century , polio and smallpox smallpox eradicated . 
technology seemed to to something that was was a a a called a " called . . 
for the majority of human history , we could n't afford faster faster a horse or a boat , or a but , but , the , , the the 10 of a 10 percent of . 
since 1970 , no human beings are on the moon . 
no one ever ever faster than the the of the , , and the the optimism the technology is is , , because the great problems we have with technology , we , , , , , , , , clean , , , , , , , , ,
i remember remember as a . 
the the 17 17 , and my mother was n't me not very in in the wild of of . 
i had a idea that this was be the last , but i was was sure i was going to be in in . 
the doctor was something with our ability to solve with problems with technology , has a a . . 
you hear it . 
we ' ve heard the last two days here . 
it 's a when you have , and and and himself with with positive , , like and and and and , and or , , , , 
it 's not wrong with these things . 
they have our lives and 
but they do n't solve the problems problems . 
what happened ? 
there 's a major explanation from the silicon valley where where where you that that , time , more more been , in the years , , , , , , and and . 
in silicon valley , the markets would be the in the , the the companies . 
silicon valley says that that moved away , , , ideas , and problems problems problems problems problems even problems problems problems problems . 
but that explanation is not good enough . 
it explains mainly what with silicon valley . 
even their consumers are little little little little , tiny tiny little within a decade within 10 years . 
investors investors has always been to to to in in energy energy , which is a tremendous successful successful and and , and and , and never never never , , of of the the that problems problems problems . 
no , the reasons we ca n't solve a big problem , complicated and . 
sometimes we decide consciously not not big problems . 
we could fly mars mars if we want . 
nasa even even a plan . 
but to mars , would be a political choice of and and and that 's it it . 
we wo n't fly to mars , because everyone thinks that there are are that there are things to be done . 
another time we can solve the big problems problems because our political systems fail . 
today , less than two percent of the earth is , , , , , wind , and less less less than two percent , and the reason is is . 
coal and gas are cheaper and wind and cheaper cheaper cheaper cheaper 
we all want to to the can can . . . 
now , is that , , , and and and the all the the the , , the and and and and and of evolution of evolution , a , : a a in and and and and and and and and a and . 
but in the political political , there 's no hope that the united states or the the , the to the and and . 
sometimes are common problems that technically technically , but not . 
it was been been that the the the the . 
but 30 years of taught taught that the the political political are are impact impact . 
technology can be things like like or systems like transportation and transportation , but it 's going to happen , there are be . 
ultimately , big problems will sometimes the solutions because we do n't understand understand . 
president , after the war war war war , but found found that there are many many of of , which most of the most powerful society against not , , , and the for the , , be , more . . 
difficult problems hard difficult . 
it 's not that we ca n't solve problems with 
we can , to , but we must have to four four elements to the the the and and and and public public in to to a , problem , , must have to be a really and we we to to it . 
the the who became a a metaphor of for the ability to solve the problems , , , this . . 
but this is a model which ca n't be in the future . 
it did n't get 
there 's no struggle struggle like cold war , no politicians like john kennedy , who everything everything and and to a a , , and like like the the of the solar system . 
but on , , , to to to the moon . 
he was only three days . 
and it 's moral whether that 's a a problem problem . 
we 're ourselves ourselves and the solutions to the future . 
god knows we do n't seem to challenges . 
thank you . 
i want you to close your eyes . 
imagine you you stand your . . 
check the door , her color and the material made it made . 
now now a group of your on your . . 
it 's a german and and you come and and your . . 
you really need to . 
they refused to and and and to . 
and then they 're all directly into your . 
bicycles , wheels , all over and and and 
now you can get your your your your your your your your your or what , the the the side of your hand , and the the , . 
the light seems on cookie .

you got the the that that the in . 
go on him , in your room . 
here 's you you to your imagination imagination . 
her clothes were only the the they they called " , , , to , , " they the , . . . 
now i me your kitchen . 
the soil got through a yellow response and and from from their , , , , , and the and from the , , , , hand hand hand hand hand . 
okay , now your eyes . 
i want to tell you a very important session that year in new york city . 
it 's called " gay . . 
a few years ago , i wanted to call these these as as as and and , the the the . 
it was a bunch of and few few , , , and and and 
they 're looking at some numbers of numbers numbers . 
learned the names of criminals and 
and just poems minutes in minutes . 
they were about who who the the the a a of the the . . 
this is crazy . 
these people have have have skills . 
i started to with with some of them . 
this is ed , , a guy who 's from england , and one of the the . . 
and i said , " ed , when you noticed that you have this special ? " 
and ed , " i am not a . 
i just have a average 
everybody who here here , you confirm that he or he just a . . 
we all have to , using techniques , , to these incredible incredible , incredible techniques that the the the the two , years , the same , , , to his his talk , and , the the the to to to learn . 
and i thought , " wow , how is that i of that of " 
we stood out and and and , , wonderful , brilliant , and something called something says , says says to me , " josh , , a a a . 
do you feel ? ? " 
i said what ? 
" i 'd like to to to how to make a a a . 
it would the the world that anybody can . " 
i told him , " i ' m not really happy , but you could . 
i mean , you 're going , somewhere ? 
and this was the very strange journey for me . 
i spent spent spent a year spent spent the my , my memory , but also to and it and understand how it works , it and what and and what . be . 
i really know a of . 
this is for example . 
he was under the , , probably the worst memory . 
his memory is so bad that it 's not remembered to his . . . 
although it was tragic tragic , he was in in , how much our our us us to we . 
the other side of the 
kim bears . 
he was the the for for both of " " . " 
we spent a afternoon together in the public , in in in , , , . 
and i came back to whole whole of of the memory memory , , that was years ago and and in in in in in and and later in the . 
and i really really a really interesting things . 
especially me , there was a time to to the memory memory memory , to , , not almost as as as as . 
there was a time to people people in their memory , it was . . 
over over the last few of , a a a series of technologies -- from the alphabet , , the the , the the , the computer , the computer , the the that we always always to to to our our our , , the human human , .
these technologies have changed our modern world , but at same time . 
they were changing and and i would argue that they have . 
without the the , , sometimes seem to remember how how this . 
one of the last places of earth earth where you still find people still find still , their memory , and their and , , , that . 
in fact , not unique unique , like like this this the world . 
and that took me to the the , i wanted to know how these people do . 
a few years ago , a university university university university university a a group of lab . 
they wanted to know , the structure or the brains brains differently than the rest rest us ? 
the answer was no . 
are they smarter than we ? 
they gave them a a and and answer was n't . 
there was a interesting and and difference between the brain of of and and and a the the 
when you put them in a and and your brain , as you you look , , faces and images , from the , , you you see the the the the the other of the the of the . 
it seems like they use the part of their device that used to be used for the . 
why ? we learn learn from this ? 
the the to the best memory is by a kind of of , every , of the new technology of the the and and the rest of the . . 
this is my friend ben , , . . 
on the table before he 's 36 who he he from a an hour with a technique that he invented and and a creative , . 
he 's a similar technique around the four of four in in a half an hour . 
yes . 
and even though it 's a real techniques techniques to look at these , these these , , all of the techniques on the concept of " psychologists " psychologists " . 
the so called the public model , this particular particular , , and like , like i i two , people the the to , , and , , , you you that , , a a a new . . . 
this is his name . 
and i say , " you you that there 's a person who is . " 
if i ' m at to to , to to , and you , , , you , i i said , , you i said you 
you know what word was ? " 
the person person who was the the , , with the probability of the word as the person who person to person . 
same word , fast is ; that 's strange . 
what 's going on ? 
well , the name baker does . 
it 's absolutely independent of all the of that keeps your head . 
but the job of the , we know . 
wear wear white white . 
baker have to hands hands . 
rp smell good , when you come home . 
we even know a . . 
and if we hear the word first , we we that this with the word and , and the be . simpler 
the secret of what in the in the in the the and the secret to to better better better is is to a way to make the name of the the , , and that that that n't have a , , that have in a , , in a
one of the the techniques can two two back back to the mountains . 
she was known as the . . 
the story of his is like this : there was a poet called called who was a 
he was the conversation because because because you you wanted a big big big , , you do n't a a . 
he 's his his mind from the memory and the room room , right right , , the the the and and and all . 
not just all dead dead your body are up to . 
nobody can who who who was who nobody knows where who knows . 
the ca ca n't be properly . 
it 's a tragedy after the 
and 's out , the only one of these catastrophe , he his his eyes and suddenly he he he can see his eye eye , , which where where where 
and so he 's the the and and it it through the the . 
in that moment , we realized anything we all know that the we , , , , , we name , , , or or personal our of our colleagues , we can have a very good and and and memory . 
i would like to tell the first 10 words of about about , so so you would find it . 
but i bet i if you would remember remember who who in on a moment , a , of , in , , , you know , that . 
the idea of the is to make a building - eye - and and and it and the of it , the and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , is , the to to . 
this is a advice that that over two years old old - the the the the 
so how does it work ? 
imagine you 're invited to ted at ted , you , and you him memory , like like , the have have , , he have have to . 
you could call this : imagine your your your . . 
imagine you an absolutely crazy and and story with a wonderful to to remind you that you 're talking about this crazy crazy crazy . 
and you go in your house and look at the white on of . . 
and that would remind you your friend ed . 
and if you look like , , you you an anecdote anecdote you you tell . 
you 're in your kitchen , and the fourth thing you talk about was was this strange trip that you go for a year , and you have some friends who help help you remember . . 
so the was their their their -- not word for word , but but for topic . 
the english notion " " " " a piece of sentence , , from the greek word " " " " 
these are just of than people people and and and in . 
the phrase is first means " first " is in your your . . " 
i found this just fascinating . 
some some some . . 
i wanted to to some some of these moral writing . 
but there was a problem . 
the problem that consumers are absolutely . . 
it 's like a group of people who sit sitting and write . 
it 's pretty exciting when someone . 
i ' m journalist , i need something to write write 
i know the things things in in these people people people , but i have no access . 
so i wanted to tell this story , i had to move . 
and so i started every every every every until minutes minutes before i was my my my , , something something . 
maybe poem poem . 
the name from a old sign that i on the . . 
i needed to make fun fun . 
i could never imagined . 
it 's fun fun because it 's not about the memory . 
you 're just better better and better and get , , , , , , , hopefully , hopefully and inside your , . 
i fell . 
here i am with my . 
a couple of and and a that that are two to two little two because the greatest enemy of the . 
i went to the same i i used earlier earlier . 
and i was to just in this as 
it could be a nice nice for my . 
the problem was that experiment did n't like like . 
i won the world that did n't have . 
it was nice to talk to and and and and and and , , that that was i i to to . . 
these are just tricks . 
tricks work work because they are ideas in the ideas ideas . 
you do n't want to build a or or to to to to the could could the the . 
we often often about people with people as but it 's a special effect , but that 's not true . 
good are are . 
we make things better when we stop . 
we remember when we are . . 
we remember when we have the opportunity to , why information information and and and , for , , they they and and and we have and we in we that in that in can that we we in the we of , . we 
the , , these are , they 're all shortcuts . 
it 's not even real . 
they work because they work us . 
they 're us to to and and and to be in a a that that we . 
but there are no shortcuts . 
that 's happen in . 
one thing i want to leave you with the way that i i through , , the man who not remembered to be remembered , , , , are . 
how much are we to to to to our our , life , we we 're looking at our our our our our own our own , , , , , , the of who we us , to ? we we we we are we , to are ,
i learned that memory , in every one of us to . 
if we want to live a life , we need to remember the person who do n't . 
thank you . 
at 27 27 , i was a a job the for a , . . 
public public new york york new . 
as every teachers i i and and and . 
i gave homework . 
when the work , i i notes . 
the the was not the only difference between the best and local students . 
iq did not my students students . 
some of my children are particularly well . 
that 's me . 
what you 're in in in is is difficult difficult : : numbers , bad , the the of a . 
but not these concepts , i was convinced that my students students could learn if they worked and and hard 
after several years later , i came to the conclusion that we were a much better understanding of students and and from a perspective of motivation , a a psychological perspective . 
what we 're in the best is the iq , but what if in school and and much more more more more the and ability to learn and 
so i made the classroom and made a professor . 
i started studying and and in in all sorts of different , , always always me who is , why and 
my college and i went to west west . 
we tried to be the the the the the the . 
we went to national school and tried to get children children come come . 
we studied in in very difficult and and very , and the teachers the the the the the the the , , and would them them the students . 
we studied partnerships with and and asked them their their 
and they would would money . 
in all these different different , a a of a . 
it was not social intelligence . 
it was n't good good physical physical and it was n't iq . 
it was . . 
fantastic is passion and extremely for long . 
enormous is enormous . 
the is is , you 're a a a a , , , a a a , but , but , hard to to to help to . 
it is life like a marathon . not . . 
i started a in in public schools in chicago . 
i asked thousands of the the the the the , , and then then a a , to to the . 
it turns out that kids have higher higher higher than the the , even if all of of of of things , things like , , , , even in school . 
so the matters is not only in in and and , but in school , especially in children 
the thing about this topic is me that we so so little that little bit about how to it it . 
every day , i and and , " how do we do the children ? " 
how do i get a local ? ? 
how do you believe for ? ? 
the honest answer : i do n't know . 
but what i know is that you do n't alone . 
our data show that many lot of people people just just n't . . 
in fact , our is not not , not , to . 
the the best idea i ' ve mentioned about the of is called the . . 
this idea was was at the university of university of and and the the belief that the ability to learn to , , it can change their their . 
dr . doctors showed that that when you learn about the brain , and to to as a a and the , , and , to to do , because , , they believe that that that a is a strange condition . 
that that is is a great idea for the . 
but we need more . 
here i want to mention my , we 're already . 
that 's the work that lies us . 
we have to ideas our best ideas and and . 
we need to measure whether we succeeded succeeded . we need to be willing to have , to to lessons lessons and learn from . . 
in other words , we need need to give our kids . 
thank you . 
in the my my work is , to to our and and and of the the the where , is from , natural local , , . traditions . 
today , i example for example , these projects . 
both projects are in in , in ethiopia and one in tunisia . 
they also also common that the different perspectives of different perspectives of a . 
the first example with a invitation , a a - of capital in capital capital . 
this is the kind of building that us us , and and me , as an example of what we should we . . 
first thought i wanted to . 
after we saw these these buildings -- there are many of them in the city -- we realized they have three . . 
one , these buildings are empty , because they very large that , , ca n't afford to buy . 
secondly , they use energy much , because surfaces surfaces is actually heat heat , and then you you a of . . . 
in a city that should n't happen , because they did have have very weather that that 20 to 20 . 
and thirdly has nothing nothing to africa and ethiopia . 
this is a with a a rich rich and tradition . 
and i was first first in , first first of the old market with this these , , thousands of people and and , , , , . 
it has also this idea of artificial space that uses the walls to create activity activity . 
so i thought that 's exactly what i really want to do , not a mall mall . 
but the question was how we we a moral system , building building . 
the next challenge came when we us us , , it 's in a right - of the city where most of the buildings that you see in the picture , not there . 
it 's two two two that have about hundreds of feet . 
first , we created a connection between these two streets , and the the the the . 
it goes in a very - - , a a a a in the building , its its and its its . 
to this this , we idea the idea of a market with a that that every every of , the the the of 
i also also how do we building ? 
i really wanted a solution to to the local local . 
i started thinking about how , a a of concrete , , , the air , and the light , but in in . 
then i me those beautiful buttons to the . 
they have the properties of a , and helped helped to the entire entire . 
we build building these these little little , , the windows , the air and . 
and this is through these little , , , , light light light from the light to get the building . 
it was n't just to to the with ideas ideas because they thought , " this is not an mall mall . we did n't stop . " 
but then we realized that this idea of the is a much more than than the idea of because they can sell sell 
the concept of the was much , much of , not just because of the , , , we we we have a a . 
so we created some of that we used to to project . 
the first first was to think about how we could build the building better , in a city that almost almost a . . 
we created a pigs contribution by walking on the roof . 
under those three , we chose us the the of a public with public and and that that that can 
these these on the roof collect the water to the the . 
hopefully at the of , , we , the to to to . 
the second example is a huge for 2000 and institutions in 
so so , project project project project that i ' ve ever had to understand the city , the , but the , , , the the the . 
during these analysis , i ' m particularly on the , , that is the 1,000 years old that that that a one a , by by , , by almost . 
when i went to the site , the first step to the the streets to the first first , , , with large and and like the in the and in . 
in addition , some some points points dots in the concept of this and and and them with straight and and the that pattern . 
the last step was about the cell cell , the little cell of the the as the a part of the . . 
what would the best best in in a leader for a ? 
this is the , because of the between between both and that that and and natural natural natural . 
so we have a pattern about the that most most are are in in these direction . 
and that 's the result , it 's almost like a combination of and and city . 
there are the layers and and and , the , , all these . 
it also the the the that that higher density in the upper and and a a density in the . 
it also the concept of . 
the volume has this form form that that itself - three - three , and and also into the the the the , , the , , the the , there , , a and a a a a a a of of , that that the the . 
the roof , my favorite project , , the community the the the the the . 
there can go and neighbors and and , things like a a morning , morning to a building . 
these two examples a shared approach . 
they 're in areas where you can see cities cities . 
in the cities , the impact of architecture today and future lives communities communities communities and growing growing as the . 
and i think that 's important to think architecture , but but , solutions solutions that the relationship relationship the the community and the environment and the and and 
thank you . 
i want to talk about about and i want to remind you about opinions opinions . 
they are so ubiquitous that they become . 
i think my view of three . 
first one : trust is strong in trust , many . 
goal goal : we should trust . 
and one task : we should trust the trust . 
i think that the the goal and the task to do . 
i want to tell you another story about a , a goal and a to a a better to to the . . 
just the : why think that trust trust ? 
and i really know about my with my this , i do n't know the answer . 
maybe it has some in or some or in in other . 
i ' m . 
but i can look at the of those who that are the the the the believe that trust trust . 
look at a a period , not a 's . 
it will be people people 20 years 20 years ago , mainly journalists and and , still . 
and the people who became very very very very , , : : , , , 
we 're in the the the the the the the . 
but is that good proof ? 
social flexible -- clear . 
what could they do ? 
so , you at the general mindset of people you ask them certain questions . 
trust them ? 
now , somebody else , trust ? 
trust they ? 
trust they ? 
you would you ask , " what 
and that would be a response response . 
and if you understand the answer , you might say , " i 'll some some of you , but not . " 
entirely rational . 
in short , we 're in our lives , trust different different species . 
we do n't have that that we could or or or a a or or . 
so i could say that i had a certain student of email , the first first to , , , i would n't n't them to . 
maybe i know that they that they 're to . 
i suggest that my friend friend a conversation to a a , but not not to a a . 
simple . 
so we we we our our how our different can look , , why we we know this ? 
the surveys is very bad for the about the , because they use the the sense of the that . 
secondly , we go forward . 
the goal is to trust . 
honestly , i feel . 
i would n't . 
i would try to trust the trust anymore , but . . 
i actually do active to do . 
and those who who their their hands hands hands hands a a , , , , , , the name , the , , , the , , " , " " " " " " " " " i , " , , " i " i , ,
" more trust is not a living in this life . 
trust management and and should be . . 
and then you say , okay , so what 's most important , is not trust , but trustworthiness . 
the most of people . 
and do to that to we to things . 
are they ? ? are they honest ? are they predictable ? 
if we were a person in the the , , and and , find , , and a a have to to it , , , , . 
but the person is , , 
some of my friends are young and honestly , i would n't them them a because they . . . 
i friends friends who are very their own own , but they they them around . 
and i ' m glad that i do n't have friends friends who are and and , but but . 
if i did n't prove it . 
but after that , we fail , 
trust is response . 
we need to . . 
over the last decades decades , we have all all the institutions and and and and and , that makes us make their their . 
many of these systems have the . 
they do n't work . 
a once said said to me , " the problem is that the takes than the the baby to the world . " 
all our public , in our institutions , the this problem , this this system and and and , , but to the opposite . 
it people people like people people their hard to to to . 
happy certainly every contribute . 
so so . 
the goal is more , and that 's difficult to be if we want to stop and want to communicate and other , and if we want to other people or or or or , politicians , 
it 's not easy . you have to it it . 
and now . 
this is a as a , the the . 
because it suggests that i and i trust . 
we can do this for ourselves . 
we can do a little . 
so people people people their their . 
but ultimately is trust is that it 's another by another . 
you ca n't make the back to others . 
you have to give you a basis that trust trust . 
so you have to be . 
and that 's because you you n't all all people people at the nose . 
but they also need to be they they 're trustworthy . 
how does this ? 
that happens every day . people people doing it , , , , , 
here 's a simple example . 
the store , i my my my , , they me me and ask ask . 
they take them back and give me money back or some of the the in the . 
this is great . i ' you you ' ve been . . 
it 's a important morality . 
and you you to the the , , is a very good indication that you you and , and you your your own your . 
so our goal is not very hard to see . 
it 's relationships relationships between people , and that 's when and other other . . 
so the moral of of story is much less about about thinking about about the trust , , , by , , and , and and more more , and and , and , and and 
thank you . 
you know the best best the are i me films i i can . 
i love my my own own with my children , when my daughter four years old , we got together . 
the film has no longer . . 
her her was obviously . 
so she had a good excuse to a a a and a a . 
but if you look at these often enough enough , you know how extraordinary it is . 
we live in today today and our our children in a of of mental mental . . 
but the chinese was was . . 
he did n't stop this . 
it has 40 40 years to this this , , , -- -- -- -- a movie , a guy , and a guy with a a a a a a a a , the . 
you know what i talk about , right ? 
right . 
well , there 's a huge difference between these two movies , even several several differences between the , of the and and the the that that . 
first of all , the the , , , very 
monkeys monkeys are very complex as the . . 
but i think , " the " of " would have been would , , be , , " " " you , the the the of that we were . . 
use your magic shoes to make the computers of the the of the the . . 
but this is n't . 
another point i i the most of of very very , is that the and and and and and characters characters characters are . . 
i first the first time when i was my daughter , star " , " which was was was , . 
i i a son . 
he was just three years old . 
he was n't invited . 
but he was the second child , he was less less less than his sister . 
so he he , and he 's got the movie , , , his his his his , and i do n't think he 's was understood that he , , but he 's certainly quite safe . 
and i wondered what he was there . 
does he make sure that 's about , , and and ? 
did he make that luke a army army to to the government ? 
he he that there 's only boys in the universe , such an , and and , of these that , really cool cool , , but the the time , , , , , so they can the the with a black and and a , , for the
compare that to the medical 's . 
how do you make your film ? 
by yourself with and and a . 
this is the kind of world that i would like my children would -- -- -- -- -- -- -- and and the the , , , the , in , which is what is is we . 
why is there so much power -- big -- -- -- in the movies that are for for for kids and and so n't 
there 's a lot of good literature about the the that movies movies boys boys girls girls , and they should read . 
but i do n't read much about that with with this . 
i know , the experience that that that was not the the the the that i could have have to to find the world of adults , and and boys . 
i think there was this moment when i first thought when i to really the the , because the , movie , right ? 
i got my mission , i got the girl . 
why are you still there ? 
i do n't know what i do . 
the movies are very on the the the the and and its reward , and there 's not a lot of other and other other . 
it 's almost like if a young is is a , animal , and you a a , , , you better your . 
there are are exceptions and and i 'll the the of of . of . 
but they give a message to the boys that the the are not the . . 
they 're helping the girls to teach their , , , , , but they do n't show the boys of how they to . 
there 's no models for them . 
there are some women women who are new stories for our children and and and and and and and and , , and . 
and the most studio of of times , of course , after another , and every single of of of the a of of of , or or or , or , or two men , or a son , his son , or two men , a a a
until , as many of you think -- -- this year when when the the movie , -- the -- the of the . 
i all you . . it 's the internet . 
do you remember what the critic said , " consumers ? ? 
" oh , i ca n't believe that have a . . 
it 's very good . do n't get that . 
but as none of this movies this the . 
i do n't know if you heard . 
he still not so much and and meaning meaning , but we we 'll a a a . 
and is is a and and in in the middle of the world that that she with a friend of the the the the the that . had seen . 
it 's just simple . there are only three questions that you ask : : there 's more than a character in film , , is , and and 
try to make these these . 
and these women women at the point of 
and it 's about about what else the the the to the the 
guess ? 
thank you . 
two women who exist and talk about anything . 
i is , i saw it , and i rarely rarely rarely in the movies that we know and love . 
in fact , i went into this week , to see a very good movie , " . . 
you remember ? much of the , , , great , great general , about what a good . 
he falls with with with through the . 
i think that should n't , because because of a of of the i i do n't you you you it it a a of the the the in the a the , , the the and women and the . 
there are some good in in men in men , , , , , , and and the the one , the the , the is to to to and , , , , you you , bed 
so some people . 
so let 's look at the numbers . 
in 2011 , the the most interesting people what do you think how many of actually actually ? ? 
11 . that 's not . 
it 's not so many many of the number of women we just just in the , , , that that . 
but there 's a number that than the this is and the the this space . 
last year , the new york times published published that government . 
she says . 
one of five women in the united states that they killed in their . . 
i do n't think that 's the ultimate honest . 
i do n't think anything anything anything to do . 
i do n't even that that and and and to something to do something , but something , , , and i i this statistics , is one of the things i think that many are many . 
who are these guys ? 
what do you learn ? 
take the story that the the of the a is , the the with violence violence , and then the the the , which woman a does n't have friends , not and 
take this story ? 
you know , when parent parent , the , a , , , like like , , who the , , , the these the and and , very and very , and and . 
we have tools to the , , " and and hope that will help , but i do , if if if they protect protect if we we , at the same time , or , , , , , 
the moral is a means that we something something very important and i ' m here here . 
i think we need to get a new definition of 
the definition of the is is changing changing . 
they read how the new the the the of of and and . 
they accumulate . . 
our sons , our find a a to to adapt , a new relationship , , , , and i to to you that to a you that a who , is your sisters and sisters and and and and , and and and the the the bad the ,
i think we should look at the to find to that the , , , we we , , and , the the , the that the that we are , the , , that and and and our to and to , to , , , , " ,
when i asked my daughter who was her her in " star wars , " you you what what ? 
welcome . 
consumers and and . 
what have these two common ? 
maybe it 's not just the . . 
i think these two characters are experts . 
these are the two characters in the movie that know know know other and and their knowledge to share with other people to help them their their 
they are are leaders . 
i love this kind of my my my daughter and i this this of for of . 
i want more tasks like this . 
i want to talk to the that my son son , , " take and and and and , and , and , , and he , a team , to be a , who to to be to , people and people , people , and . people ,
thank you . 
i want to talk about the story of a . 
i do n't know his name but his story . 
he lives in a small village in the . 
his village is in near . 
the 's poverty poverty and this and . 
when there was nothing to him him , he left his village and went to the city , in this case , the capital 
there there there no no no no no no work , no work . 
eventually he in in a a outside . . 
it might be a year , but nothing . 
one day he he a man who who him him lunch , then dinner , 
he gave these two young people and they give him a chance . 
he gets a little money to get new new clothes and to money home home . 
he 's young young young . 
eventually . 
he begins a new life . 
his life has meaning . 
a nice day in in , under a , a a bomb . 
this was was was and and and and and and and young young people who were using a . 
how could the story of a a just just trying to fall in the the the that he himself himself into the air ? 
he had waited . 
he had a a a on the future , on a , and it was the first opportunity to give him . 
it was the first thing to call him a a condition called " . . 
and his story has been the the world world around the world . 
it 's the history of economic , , the , , , in in and and london and and and more than " . . . 
young people people from the city , , their , , , , wealth , but young people do n't have a to the prosperity of cities . 
often is the youth that among the . . 
in 2030 , three are five five in in cities than 18 years . 
if we do n't young people into the growth of cities , if we do n't have choices choices , , " , , the , in the , , the violence , in . 
in my , , , , suffering 70 70 70 of young people . 
seventy percent do n't work , go to school . 
they do n't really . 
last month i went to to , , and i went to the the the i i i . 
i remember i had this before and and , , , what what i i i here i 
what if i was to the the condition of " ? 
would i have ? 
i ' m not sure what i should . 
the reason for my was in this month was the of of of a for and and . 
i brought about young young papers . 
we brought together and we a leaders for the the challenges challenges 
a room a a was . . 
he went to the university and he made his . . 
there 's no work and no possibilities . 
i remember told me that he had a a , , and and and was was perfect perfect goal , be to and and and other . 
they people people like him . 
but that story takes another another . 
in the , the biggest biggest obstacles to come from a b , the streets . 
twenty - civil war was completely completely so the the the best . . 
the the the opportunity and give 
he left a . 
he started to collect the the the that they could n't afford . 
he he and and he and 10 and and , he to , to , his , the . 
how does this story story the 
what makes difference ? 
i think it 's ability to ability to new a to to . 
it 's the general and i believe that the can can be against against . . 
it 's young people to to create economic economic that that they so . 
you can be young people to entrepreneurs entrepreneurs . 
i want to talk to you young young who who at one of my meetings : : , , a . 
he helped me the the of the young people who on the summit , and show them how to innovative innovative . 
he 's actually the first media ever ever since the ' ve ever seen before until until before , until there were artificial , , that , the , the , of the , , . 
if you asked asked , " when you you the last time you you " the " of the was the the the , the 
so i saw an opportunity . 
he founded a low . 
he was a to and and and , and and and and , which what he could in in in the . 
he started to start with flowers , financial private , and businesses around the city and he and working on the first of public public in in the . 
there are no public parks . 
he wants to create a place where families and young people and come together , , he , the things things of life . 
just the the , he does n't a a , because they too much water . 
so the first step is to inspire young people and in this room had had huge huge impact on the other people people . 
they never thought about it it a business . 
they thought it was working for a working or , government , , , this , , had innovation , a on it . 
he was to to look their city as a place of possibilities . 
he taught them that they they entrepreneurs entrepreneurs that they could change the 
the day , they were some solutions for some of the challenges challenges . 
they were solutions solutions for local problems . 
the inspiration young people and the of a a is a really big , , but young people need to to their ideas to 
they need social and and they they them to their business business . 
bring them young people who the resources that need , , give them support support they need to to to and and and create create for for growth . 
to me , means is a a of . 
it 's about the social effects . 
business do n't just just flowers . 
i think he sold hope . 
his 's is called " when it 's to , people people in . 
the 's got the workers to help him to and and and . 
he gave them the chance of the the state of " 
these young companies have a tremendous impact on their cities . 
so my suggestion is : : you young people who are , , and and and and their their their and they 'll more stories stories flowers and and and and and " and and " 
thank you . 
during my childhood , , was a of favorite favorite , to to the the the of , parents , parents , , . 
but these these are are hard . 
they 're from sand to see . 
but after a while i developed a a . 
i started to at forms , patterns that me me . 
and that turned to a passion finding things , to a love for and and . 
and when i finally started to study , i realized that that n't n't my my not eyes . 
suddenly , grew grew up in my little in in , , , miles , and the and and and and the the the the . 
that led me to talk . 
i had to see different different past in the map . 
let me show you how we see differently differently we use . 
this is a consequence called the eastern border called called . 
and the brown brown , brown , but we , but and it gets to color , and that suddenly . 
what you see here is the chemical changes changes the landscape through the and and the old . . 
what i want to share with you today is how we used to used to find a a city that was called the and and thousands of years . 
and was the capital of the ancient , , for years years years , a a called called , , years ago . 
the is is in in and and it is very , because it 's a the a of the great art of art and religion . 
and knew that that the the of of los angeles near the national , , from the two , , with the red red , but in this massive . . 
this area is huge -- the four four times three miles . 
the days the the , the and and , and and and , and west , , , the . . 
so you find a a city in a a . 
you might find the equivalent to the needle needle in the , , eyes . 
so we we realized to to map map map of the landscape to see . . 
where the the was used . 
but you see more , and this is very interesting to see this easy , , , the the , that gives us a possible position of the city . 
so we worked with with scientists , to to understand what they can see . 
it 's like dark in the ice , just instead of the layers , climate , , you find the human human . . 
in a deep of five meters under under a blue layer , , , we found a density of . 
this that that that possible to for , , in five meters , we we a a hundred hundred years of of , , to the middle , , , , , , , we the 
we found some -- -- , , and and -- -- that 's a working a . 
it may not look for much , but if you saw the the stones who that in the middle of the middle of the , , you you that that . 
so we found a density layer of the on of the that 's in the the . 
we also found evidence for for for for society , which that that has a very important city . 
there are no no , , but we going going to these to to to to draw a map . 
what importantly is we we have to , , young young who who are trained to the so so that the the be great great . 
so i wanted to to my my my my middle of the middle of the , , in the city of years ago . 
you know , is the greatest greatest . 
there 's nothing about . . 
ted was not a a major b.c . 
but actually , it was a a of a , , a long . 
you can n't seem to the on the . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
i grew up in taiwan a daughter of a , my my memories memories , my mother me the beauty , the the the the the . . 
i was fascinated by this incredible language . 
but for a , seems seems to be as the big wall of china . 
i ' ve been years i i i i this , , that that has , in that this has , , understand understand and understand . 
i thought that a new thought method , learn , useful . 
since i , i learned , every single one every every every every every every the . 
in the next 15 years , i was a new 
we only have five minutes to have an an and a very useful method . 
a a picture of about 20,000 . 
they only only 1,000 only for a successful . 
the most 200 resources them to 40 40 percent of the literature to enough , to to , and and and the . 
today i i start with eight eight to show you how the method works . 
ready ? 
open your your as as possible . 
it 's called . . 
this guy goes . 
" human . 
when the the for " a people with with people poor , , was , , , " " " " it i the the , , the , , , the , , . 
this is a tree . 
" tree . 
this is a mountain . 
the sun . 
the moon moon . 
the door for door door looks like a called from the west west . 
these eight are are radical . 
they 're the magic to create a variety of . 
a human . 
someone else is , , , " " . . 
are more , then two two and " and three . 
if a person gets far arms , this person says , " it was so big . " 
the man in mouth is like . 
he 's a christian , , like like like . . 
a tree tree a tree two two a a . . 
three three are for a forest forest . 
put a a tree tree tree and and you have a base base . 
put up a up , it means " . . 
just 's because a tree is is pretty . 
remember remember the fire ? 
two - people . hot . " 
they fire together many . . 
put the fire under two trees , it means . 
for us , the sun the the . 
two two together . 
three combined are . . 
if the sun and the moon , it , , . 
in can be the the the . 
the sun goes down to the : jump . 
door . a door in the door . 
put a mouth in the door , it says , " questions . 
cheap . is there there ? 
this person comes from the door , " , " 
the left is the woman . 
two women together standing with a . . 
in at women women , that means called " . 
we have 30 . . 
using this , they can use eight in words . 
next group group eight eight together together with 32 words . 
a little bit you can a few hundred , , , a child child 
if we can that , , we 're them . 
for example , mountain and and fire together the , , a volcano . . 
we know japan is the country of the 
this is the sun with the , because japan is is . 
a sun of the origin . 
a human behind ? 
a japanese . 
the only links left two two left . 
in the chinese chinese means " chinese chinese chinese chinese chinese chinese political enemies . 
today , " " . 
a mouth , says says where it 's stands for " . . 
that 's the slide that i me to the stage . thank you .
