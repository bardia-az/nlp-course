This homework was pretty simple. I just read the dafault solution's code and noticed its issue by watching its performance on the test and dev dataset.
My groupmate and I both came up with the idea of setting the probability of the unknown words to 0 first, which improved the accuracy on the dev dataset. But the output on the test dataset was not good enough.
Then I decided to define a new missing function that assings a more reasonabe probability to the unknown words, which improved the output of the test dataset as well.
